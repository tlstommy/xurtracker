The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

Between the Vanguard's support, generous contributions from the Awoken, and several upgrades courtesy of a lapsed Dead Orbit adherent, the ship's a lot to be entrusted with. \n\n\"These new sensors are something else,\" Isidro announces from the cockpit. \"If so much as a mouse sneezes out there in the black, we'll pick it up.\"\n\nRahila squints at him. \"A mouse?\"\n\n\"Space-mice.

Or mysterious, freaky signals.\" \n\n\"Vanguard will be along in a few to see us off.\" Roche-5's composed baritone emerges from the hatch leading to the cargo hold. \"You two ready?\" \n\n Rahila settles into the copilot's chair. \"To go find out what's left of our solar system? 'Course we are.\" \n\n\"Remember,\" Roche intones gravely, \"This is pure recon. No big risks.\" \n\nRahila and Isidro exchange grins. \"Sure thing.\"",

We'd talk all night and wake up with full memories of what we'd said. That was the first time I realized how powerful she'd become.\" \n\nPetra lowered her eyes. \"Of course, Pinar was Imar's favorite.

Her dreams became my nightmares.\" Petra shook her head, as if dislodging an unwelcome memory. \"That's when I quit the training and the dreams stopped.\" \n\n\"Eventually I found my place in the Corsairs,\" Petra mused, \"but part of me wishes I had finished my training as a Techeun. If I had, maybe I could still find Pinar out there, in a dream somewhere.\" She plucked a blade of grass from between the paving stones and tossed it into the breeze. \n\nAfter a pensive moment, Petra focused again on Ylaia. \"So, my suggestion is to give the training a chance. If it takes, you'll know. And if not,\" she patted the grenade launcher at her side, \"we've got plenty of other jobs for you.\"",

Red streaks burn in the star-sea sky beyond the vast cloud of asteroids and dust, drawing the shape of a new constellation as the Warmind launches fresh guns.\n\n\"An 'almighty' effort. Splendid.\" Spider steps off a transit craft, alone. \"We could have met in\u2026 a more protected place.\"\n\n\"You don't like being seen with me?\"\n\n\"The Spider is a friend to all, but not all my friends are friends,\" Spider says and focuses his gaze on the Drifter. \"You should have come to me.\"\n\n\"You keep too many bodies around. Bodies can stab you in the back.\"\n\n\"Running shows your back,\" the Spider's voice shudders, \"to everyone.\"\n\nDrifter pauses a moment and looks around at the desolate scape. Small boulders hang in space. They slowly drift towards each other, make contact, and bounce away on random trajectories. Some stick; incorporated via destructive consummation. He scowls and turns back to Spider. \"Stretch your legs. No one here for miles.\"\n\nThe Spider unfurls himself, slurping a heavy vacuumous drag from his rebreather. Fully upright, he dwarfs the Drifter in shadow. \"Isolation\u2026 is not the same as protection, friend.\"\n\n\"Friendship gonna save us from what's coming?\" Drifter asks. He places his fingertips together, the space between his hands resembling a triangle.\n\n\"The odds aren't in your favor, but\u2026\" a guttural laugh ripples from Spider's belly and sends vibration through the loose-packed dirt underfoot, \"I'm the wrong one to come to for comfort.\"\n\n\"I get it. You tried running last time. Didn't work. Now you're trying to hide. Let me give you some advice: that don't work either.\"\n\n\"Hiding? the Spider asks and waits. \"The board changes. The board clears. I don't play, I just price the pieces.\"\n\n\"Cold-blooded. World's ending and you want a run at it for all it's got.\"\n\n\"'End' is a matter of perspective. Devastation is oftentimes,\" he says with a breath, \"profitable.\"\n\n\"What if nothing's left? Skin and bones?\"\n\n\"There's always ivory among the bones.\"\n\n\"Bull.\"\n\nSpider slings a single breathy, \"Ha.\"\n\n\"You remind me of my compatriots.\" Spider wraps his fingers around a small clod of earth drifting by. \"They looked at the Whirlwind, just like you. Scared.\" He closes his hand, crushing the clod into a dense mound. It fractures into several pieces that waft away as Spider releases his grip. \"But here we are, living on anyway.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Fallen.\"\n\n\"Fallen. I hold favor among Witches, and Kells, and whispering agents\u2026 of every shade and shape. My web is vast, and I have proven useful. Let the kings bloody each other. I'll direct the runoff.\"\n\n\"You talking about Guardians? Hate to break it to you, but they're a cheap date.\"\n\n\"Cheap is malleable. Cheap becomes\u2026 cheaper in desperation.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" The Drifter pulls a small and ornate box of Awoken design from his rucksack. \"Who you lookin' for with this anyway?\"\n\nThe Spider steps toward Drifter, smothering his personal space. \"Options, my dear rogue; tangled in the web.\" He takes the box with his dominant arms and plops two stuffed sacks of Ghost shells into the Drifter's hands with his others.\n\n\"Went through hell to get that little box. Don't come with no throne,\" Drifter says, holding his voice steady, jaw tense to stay the trembling.\n\nThe Spider chitters as a shiver runs through him. \"No. Just a looking-glass window. Good business, friend.\" The hulking Fallen Don turns to leave. \"Remember\u2026 remain useful.\"\n\n\"When you find 'em, you sure the past won't come knocking?\"\n\n\"No one minds the Spider.\"\n\n\"Lucky.\"",

We are here to devise a plan.\n\nDO-AJ: We had one. It was rejected. The time for that is long past.\n\nIR: Your plan was to leave the Traveler.\n\nNM-EH: We are unprepared because we waste time debating.\n\nFWC-L2: We were prepared by every conflict that befell the City. This war has been written in the stars. Let it come.\n\nDO-AJ: Mobilize the fleet. We have guns enough. Surely, that option would please Lakshmi.\n\nFWC-L2: Yes.\n\nIR: The fire from your guns would have ricocheted off the Almighty's hull. How do you plan to wound the Pyramid?\n\nCZ: This was settled during the Red War. It has not changed. We will need the fleet in reserve should the situation turn dire.\n\nNM-EH: We will not flee the seat of our Golden Age. Enact war-time powers. A Monarch must be chosen.\n\nIR: [inaudible]\n\nNM-EH: How long has that omen been left buried on the Moon?

They are supported by Guardian operatives. They will work to contain the Darkness while we evacuate nearby assets and evaluate engagement strategies.\n\n[silence]\n\nCZ: In our haste to act, we were caught flat-footed. When we choose to strike again, we must be sure of its efficacy. We may only get one chance. You have all brought wisdom to this meeting. I have considered your council. Executor, I request the New Monarchy support us as they did so graciously when the Red Legion struck. Organize the movement of our people and coordinate with Suraya Hawthorne's contacts to secure them within the walls. Cousin Jalaal, I request Dead Orbit ships ferry the wayward home and provide transit security. In return, you will both be granted full access to the Vanguard's Luna site resources.\n\nNM-EH: A late invitation, but acceptable.\n\nDO-AJ: For the time being, we will protect caravans and aid in relocation.\n\nCZ: Good. Lakshmi, Project Stronghold will require additional printings. Ada-1 has agreed to lend her equipment and expertise to assist in this endeavor. Is this satisfactory?\n\nFWC-L2: Our forges are ready and eager. We request to assist the Bray in evaluating damage to the Warmind.\n\nCZ: Offer the help. Ana will accept it, I'm sure, so long as you defer to her oversight.\n\nFWC-L2: Her standing is tenuous. We believe it amicable to offer partnership, not support.\n\nCZ: You may suggest as much.\n\nIR: Do we have a consensus?\n\n[many voices pledge in agreement]\n\nIR: Adjourned.\n\n[nondescript shuffling and chatter]\n\n[door closing]\n\n[silence]\n\nIR: You offer too much. They want all the sway and none of the responsibility.\n\nCZ: Let them have both. Now is not the time to tangle ourselves in political conflicts.\n\nCZ: It won't be long before they realize Eris is the agent in question. She should be warned.\n\nIR: I'll reach out to her.",

They didn't seem to notice the signal. At the signal's source, I discovered a small camp of what I initially thought were Scorn. Upon further observation, I found that these were not Scorn but Fallen afflicted with some kind of flesh deformity and mental degradation. Shot one dead and the others just looked at me. They didn't fight back. Fired a few cesium charges into the asteroid hole and watched 'em burn. Just sat there. I didn't hear it clearly, but they were chanting something. I don't know. Hard to hear over the fire. \n\nThe speaker laughs to themselves and emulates popping noises. \n\nRc-9: I heard more of them whispering a little deeper in, so I waited for the area to burn out and continued inside. I found one structure of apparent Hive architecture, though it did not appear to have been constructed in any traditional sense\u2026 but then again, I don't know what I should even expect from the Hive at this point. A single Fallen was inside, became violent when I approached and brandished a weapon. The weapon was not loaded, and I put them down. \n\nRc-9: My logs will show a few recovered pieces of equipment that I will list now. One presumably organic section of the Hive structure. It is perpetually wet, just\u2026 great job on that, and causes dizziness and blurred vision when held with ungloved hands. It also has the unnerving ability to project dysphoria or general unease. I was asked to collect a sample for study by my CO. I've done that. Put it in a lead box all the way in the back of the cargo hold. Yeah. Eternal tithings to Xivu Arath. Whatever. Um\u2026 as I was saying. \n\nA tin is heard being unlatched. \n\nRc-9: Also recovered: one tube-style Grenade Launcher. It has no foundry markings. Definitely not Fallen, and I don't think the Scorn even know how to make weapons. Do the Awoken make Grenade Launchers? Always struck me as a Human weapon. Beautiful weapon. The thing wants to be used. Maybe I'll get an opportunity to use it before I get back to the Tower. Lastly, I recovered a locational tracker from one of the Fallen. Following it back to someplace else in the Reef. Little remote. I'll call in my findings once I've finished there. \n\nRc-9: Beautiful weapon. \n\nThe recording cuts.",

Civilians were being ushered toward the SMILE pods in droves as the lightning made its presence felt, igniting a nearby fuel supply. The explosion tore into the group, and as Voronin turned his head from the horror and the heat, he saw her. Roughly 250 meters away from the station. Morozova lay, singed and smoking, under rubble and ash.\n\nVoronin pulled up his sensorium, but the electromagnetic fields in the air reduced it to static. There was no way to know if she was still alive or salvageable. She had treated him with respect despite outranking him, and she had been there for him when his marriage went to hell\u2014\n\n\"We're all dead anyway,\" he thought and ran to her through the maelstrom of lightning and wind.\n\nAnd then he was there, pulling off his gloves and wiping ash and blood from her face, as the storm bore down upon him.\n\nAs he made peace with his mortality, just shy of 82 years old, the storm around them calmed. The lightning stopped. The wind died. At the station, the civilians' eyes were fixed on the sky, though Voronin was looking only at Morozova. She was breathing, barely. Her eyes opened and met his. A half-smile came across her lips, then froze as her eyes went past him and widened in awe.\n\nVoronin turned and found himself staring into the face of God.",

His hand went to his chest without thinking, as if to make sure he was fully intact. His gaze shifted as a second bolt hit the ground near him, then another. He had never seen lightning so close before. Stunned, he stood his ground; while part of him knew he should be frightened for his life, he was more perplexed than afraid.\n\nThere was no rain. He looked toward the horizon, expecting clouds, expecting something, and only saw a shimmering curtain of blue lightning sifting toward him.\n\nHe raced for shelter in the surrounding field, abandoning his munitions container in the dust kicked up by his fevered stride. The strikes razed the ground, sparking wildfires and scorching stone. There was no logic to their timing, with bolts crashing so frequently, the sound of the thunder couldn't catch up.\n\nHe'd lost Morozova in the commotion. Already drained from hours spent hauling cargo, his mind recessed into primal instinct. RUN.\n\nSo he ran, doing his best to avoid the apocalypse that surrounded him. A call came through his earpiece as the ground quaked beneath him: \"\u2026 auxiliary evac station\u2026\" was all he could make out before a roar of thunder swallowed the transmission.\n\nHe knew he needed to head west toward the station. The wind picked up and blew him off his feet, and again he felt a moment of sheer amazement at the storm's sudden ferocity. He hit the ground hard and checked his sensorium. It was scrambled from all the sinuous electricity undulating through the air, but he could just barely make out his compass. West. He ran.",

He had heard the stories from throughout the system, but never did he think he would live to see it.

The ground had gotten so hot under him, the rubber on his boots had melted. A banal thought cut through his awe\u2014\"Now I look like a fool in front of the Traveler\"\u2014and he was ashamed.\n\n\nThe sound of cracking thunder still echoed in the distance. That was when he noticed he was in the eye of the storm. It was wailing all around him, but calm in his general circumference. Surely this was the Traveler's doing. The great savior. He grabbed Morozova, unsure of how long this would last, and brought her to her feet. She was badly injured, bleeding from a wound on her leg.\n\n\"Stay with me.\" He said to Morozova and the Traveler at once. Only one of them listened.

Every step was a battle of attrition. At this point, the thought of coldsleep sounded comforting. He just had to make it to the SMILE pods. The storm had other plans. A nearby HMMWV was struck by a wayward bolt and the explosion threw them back. He felt Morozova torn from his side as he landed, and the sound of his skull hitting stone was louder than the thunder had been. As blackness crept into his vision, he saw the Traveler in the sky, moving away, abandoning him.\n\n\u2026and then he was being dragged from the wreckage and violence onto a gurney. \"\u2026Morozova?\" he struggled out. He was met with an oxygen mask. His eyes darted, in search of some sign that Morozova was alive. Voronin couldn't decipher anything out of the pandemonium around him. \"I'm sorry,\" he thought to himself while cursing the orb in the sky for deserting him.\n\nThe last thing he remembered before they placed him into coldsleep was an explosion in the sky so bright it blinded him.",

He tried to keep her leg clean while the wind caked them with dirt and debris. Lightning was drawing closer. The sterile scent of ozone had returned and he knew he didn't have much time. \"COME BACK!\" he shouted hopelessly to the God. He hoisted Morozova up, supporting her on his shoulder, and pushed back against the elements that were conspiring against him.\n\nIt was 250 meters to the evac station. Every step was a battle of attrition. At this point, the thought of coldsleep sounded comforting. He just had to make it to the SMILE pods. The storm had other plans. A nearby HMMWV was struck by a wayward bolt and the explosion threw them back. He felt Morozova torn from his side as he landed, and the sound of his skull hitting stone was louder than the thunder had been. As blackness crept into his vision, he saw the Traveler in the sky, moving away, abandoning him.\n\n\u2026and then he was being dragged from the wreckage and violence onto a gurney. \"\u2026Morozova?\" he struggled out. He was met with an oxygen mask. His eyes darted, in search of some sign that Morozova was alive. Voronin couldn't decipher anything out of the pandemonium around him. \"I'm sorry,\" he thought to himself while cursing the orb in the sky for deserting him.\n\nThe last thing he remembered before they placed him into coldsleep was an explosion in the sky so bright it blinded him.",

Certainly not as bad as whatever calamity they were prepping for, but bad enough to warrant the panic that coursed through his body. He hated these kinds of assignments.\n\n\"Hey, Morozova!\" Voronin called out to his ranking officer between heavy gasps. \"Any idea where all these are going?\"\nMorozova carefully placed her container on the ground, as if she was laying a child to bed. \"No clue. Word just came from on high to double-time it, though. Something about Titan has got everyone spooked.\"\n\nVoronin removed his helmet and wiped the sweat from his brow. Titan? What the hell happened out there? Comms had been spotty and the orders that did get through were light on details: Procure munitions. Transpo munitions to coordinates provided. Stockpile munitions. Repeat. No HMMWVs either. This was meant to be low profile, staying off the roads.\n\nWhere was all this firepower going, and what were we going to do with it when it got there? Voronin picked up his container and his pace.\n\nHe trudged just shy of a click behind Morozova for what felt like hours. These containers were cumbersome and it was the height of the driest summer he could remember.\n\nWhen they reached their destination, they received a cursory greeting from Bykov, who was busy compiling a list of all the deliverables. Two soldiers, whom Voronin didn't recognize, were placing the containers in the mouth of a shaft that protruded from the ground. One punched in a command and the shipment vanished below the surface with a hollow pneumatic \"whoomp.\"\n\n\"Where does that go?\" Voronin asked. Bykov's brows drew together and his expression hardened. He returned to his list.\n\n\"Ready for the next round?\" Morozova posed with more spunk than Voronin could muster in a year.\n\n\"If we must.\"\n\nThe sky grew gray, and clouds formed overhead as they left.

The ground had gotten so hot under him, the rubber on his boots had melted. A banal thought cut through his awe\u2014\"Now I look like a fool in front of the Traveler\"\u2014and he was ashamed.\n\n\nThe sound of cracking thunder still echoed in the distance. That was when he noticed he was in the eye of the storm. It was wailing all around him, but calm in his general circumference. Surely this was the Traveler's doing. The great savior. He grabbed Morozova, unsure of how long this would last, and brought her to her feet. She was badly injured, bleeding from a wound on her leg.\n\n\"Stay with me.\" He said to Morozova and the Traveler at once. Only one of them listened. The Traveler was on the move, and the storm was returning.",

He tried to keep her leg clean while the wind caked them with dirt and debris. Lightning was drawing closer. The sterile scent of ozone had returned and he knew he didn't have much time. \"COME BACK!\" he shouted hopelessly to the God. He hoisted Morozova up, supporting her on his shoulder, and pushed back against the elements that were conspiring against him.\n\nIt was 250 meters to the evac station. Every step was a battle of attrition. At this point, the thought of coldsleep sounded comforting. He just had to make it to the SMILE pods. The storm had other plans. A nearby HMMWV was struck by a wayward bolt and the explosion threw them back. He felt Morozova torn from his side as he landed, and the sound of his skull hitting stone was louder than the thunder had been. As blackness crept into his vision, he saw the Traveler in the sky, moving away, abandoning him.\n\n\u2026and then he was being dragged from the wreckage and violence onto a gurney. \"\u2026Morozova?\" he struggled out. He was met with an oxygen mask. His eyes darted, in search of some sign that Morozova was alive. Voronin couldn't decipher anything out of the pandemonium around him. \"I'm sorry,\" he thought to himself while cursing the orb in the sky for deserting him.\n\nThe last thing he remembered before they placed him into coldsleep was an explosion in the sky so bright it blinded him.",
