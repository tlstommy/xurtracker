The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

She imagined inscribing her name across the history of the Sol system. She imagined true freedom.\n\nBut the reality of her pirate fiefdom was less satisfying than she had anticipated. Her headquarters? A filthy hovel carved into the side of an asteroid. Her arsenal? A patchwork of discarded weapons in various states of disrepair. And her crew? Thieves and cutthroats who would try to usurp her at the slightest display of weakness. So much for freedom.\n\nOver the years, her thirst for glory was replaced by the grim need to maintain order\u2014to keep what little she had from the claws of her fickle \"allies.\" Including the pathetic Dreg now pressed against the barren asteroid. \n\nTrue, he was just a small-time cheat, acting out of simple desperation. But out here, there were no allowances for clemency, regardless of infraction. There was no room for justice in a place like this\u2014only punishment.  \n\nShe chambered a round in the Dreg's pistol and sighed.",

They eyed each other warily, waiting for the other to strike.\n\nThe encircling throng of onlookers and bettors jostled unsteadily. Those at the back surged forward recklessly for a better view, while those in front struggled against the swell, afraid of being pushed into the path of the gladiators' swords. Audience casualties were common at such affairs.\n\nTagh'al suddenly broke the stalemate with a massive cleave, aimed at his opponent's helmeted head. Thagh'urn sidestepped it with ease. His ferocious counter-slice raked across Tagh'al's armored breastplate, leaving a thick gouge in the metal. The crowd roared.\n\nFor several minutes, the massive warriors clashed. Their swords clanged in fury, scraping off one another's armor. All the while, the crowd's furor grew, held in suspense by the certainty of bloodshed.\n\nThen it happened. As the two Cabal locked blades, Thagh'urn unholstered a concealed submachine gun. He unleashed a burst of small caliber bullets into Tagh'al's abdomen at point-blank range, sending the warrior staggering backward. Those who had bet on Tagh'al howled in indignation.\n\nTagh'al pulled off his breastplate to reveal several bullet holes in his thick hide, a gout of blood spurting from one of the wounds. He looked down at the damage\u2026\n\n\u2026And let out a deep, barking laugh. Thagh'urn joined in, and soon, both gladiators were laughing uproariously amidst a spreading pool of blood.\n\nEventually, Tagh'al's laugh slowed to a chuckle. \"Well played, brother,\" he said. \"I suppose we're even now.\"",

They bore the burning sigils of War, dripping soulfire from their branded hulls as if it gushed from an open wound.  \n\nBeneath the churning sea, a Guardian Light wrapped in metal, yet to be coiled in promise, watched the skies turn to ink, and Hive fiends disembark the invading craft. \n\nProclamations scattered across the methane ocean, eager words searing each wave's crest with jade flame. The Hive's intent was clear: tear asunder the claims of the Witch Sister. Raise the banners of War. \n\nLed by a massive Knight, Acolytes descended to depths once infested by denizens of the lie, down to where the song of trickery echoed from long-dead shrieks. They marched in adorant procession, surrounded by a host of Thralls that defaced the remnant traces of Savath\u00fbn's holdings with hungering delight. \n\nHeld aloft in the claws of a central Acolyte was a Wizard's skull, recovered from the flame-licked wash before Titan's capture. The Acolyte delicately placed the skull upon a ragged sheet of conquered foe-flesh while others carved a circle of runes around it. \n\nThe Acolytes took position over the runes. They threw their heads back and howled a discordant melody that ignited the rune-circle, consuming each of them in soulfire conflagration. \n\nThe melody took hold, flooding the flesh of the accompanying Thralls with frenzy. They surged forward, kicked and clawed their kin in a mad scramble to reach the skull first. To claim it. \n\nEach time the melody thrummed, an Acolyte turned to ash. Each time the melody thrummed, spilled Thrall viscera twisted into fetid swirls around the skull. \n\nBlood and ash was offered until none remained; the Knight stepped forward, brandishing a blade of deathly menace. \n\n\"I call Xivu Arath. I invoke War's presence. Take this dreg, cast out by your sister. Take her claims as your own.\" \n\nThe churning soulflame was drawn into the Knight's deathly blade, then plunged into the Wizard's skull. The runic circle projected an ancient realm, and the Knight felt watchful eyes leering from atop a distant Black Terrace perched above that projected realm. The thunderous response pressed him to his knees. \n\nKELGORATH, I ACCEPT THINE OFFERINGS \n\nTHROUGH WILL, LIES ARE UNEARTHED \n\nTHROUGH WILL, LIES ARE MADE TRUTH \n\nTHROUGH WILL, LIES FALL TO CONQUEST \n\n KUDAZAD, BOUND, YOU ARE NAMED IN SERVICE",

She tooled the rifling in her barrels with the steady hand of an artisan. Her dyes, cobalt and ichor, shone bright as beetleshell.\n\nThe other, Gharhet, came from the distant plains. He traded for his wares and sold them dear, and thus he amassed great wealth. He embellished his goods with a rich lacquer the color of flame.\n\nWhen the Primus called for the strongest warriors to serve, the district knew the fighter Tlamus\u2014who had broken all challengers with her keen aim and powerful frame\u2014would represent them. Both Dhutus and Gharhet wished to outfit her with their finest pieces, as having a warrior of her status wear their colors would bring them great honor.\n\nSo Dhutus forged Tlamus a mighty war axe with an ice-blue handle and wide golden blade. Tlamus accepted the gift gladly.\n\nGharhet procured for her a Slug Rifle with bright orange plating, and Tlamus wore it proudly across her back.\n\nNext, Dhutus crafted a Shotgun, metal burnished deep as night with bright vents along the sides, and Tlamus brought it into battle.\n\nIn response, Gharhet bought a helm with thick plating and stout antlers the color of a sunset, and they were soon stained with the blood of Tlamus's foes.\n\nAnd Dhutus saw no end to this. Her shoulders ached from working the forge, and her hands were blistered by burns upon burns.\n\nSo Dhutus issued to Gharhet a challenge, and as he knew no one would raise the weapons of a coward, Gharhet accepted.\n\nThe next dawn found Dhutus on the battlefield waiting for her rival. On her shoulder was her finest weapon: a Rocket Launcher, its barrel a twisting column of seashell blue with gold trim, built as a gift for Tlamus but now wielded by its creator.\n\nFrom across the field, a figure strode forward to meet Dhutus\u2014but it was too wide to be Gharhet; too tall, too muscular. He had bought a champion to fight in his stead.\n\nAn orange sash was draped carelessly across her chest and dragged in the dust with each confident step. Studded orange leathers bound her massive arms and thighs. Strands of coral beads hung from her tusks.\n\nShe greeted Dhutus with a fist to her chest. \"I am Tlamus,\" she said, \"chosen of Gharhet.\"\n\nDhutus could not find her voice, and then Tlamus drew one of her beautiful, terrible weapons, and the rite was soon concluded.",

He came close; she did not step back.\n\n\"Or what? You might scare everyone else, but you don't scare me. There's nothin' you can do except put up with me.\"\n\nEris returned to her work, raising a hand and pushing him out of the way. He huffed, watching her as she resumed sharpening the points of the staff's base.\n\n\"With this, the Guardian may devise rituals of their own. It will empower their Light and channel the Hive's vile power.\"\n\n\"You're welcome,\" Immaru said smugly.\n\nEris ignored him and examined the staff she had crafted. It represented hours spent sliding a blade's edge over layers of dead, porous Hive chitin, carving it with spells and imbuing it with magic. At its head was soulfire ichor, encased in vitreous Light. A gleaming vessel.\n\n\"One last reagent.\"\n\nShe turned back to her worktable. The worm squirmed and squealed under her knife.",

The feed he was about to watch could easily be misconstrued.  \n\nAs it was, the City smoldered with rumors from citizens and Guardians alike. The persistent, undulating hole in the Traveler's side put everyone on edge. Hearing that Vanguard leadership was using Hive magic to fulfil a bargain put forth by the Witch Queen would undoubtedly stoke the flames of panic. \n\nZavala leaned grimly over his desk to watch the Guardian's latest tithes to Eris Morn.  \n\nIt used to be simple, he lamented. We exterminated the Hive wherever we found them, and we felt good about it. Justified. But in recent years, morally ambiguous situations like these had become more common, and separating friend from foe was increasingly difficult. \n\nOver the feed, Eris Morn's face lit up with fierce elation as the Guardian's tithes flowed through her. Her Hive form seemed to swell with power. Zavala knew that Eris undertook the rituals with temperance, at least for now, but he wondered how long her clarity would last. Elsie Bray's warnings had been too vivid to dismiss entirely, even after Ikora's reassurances. \n\nZavala turned away from the feed to gaze out the window at the Traveler. The trauma puncturing its side reminded him of the stakes. The reasons they were taking such risks. \n\nHe sighed, wondering how many more compromises they would have to make before the end.",

He came close; she did not step back.\n\n\"Or what? You might scare everyone else, but you don't scare me. There's nothin' you can do except put up with me.\"\n\nEris returned to her work, raising a hand and pushing him out of the way. He huffed, watching her as she resumed sharpening the points of the staff's base.\n\n\"With this, the Guardian may devise rituals of their own. It will empower their Light and channel the Hive's vile power.\"\n\n\"You're welcome,\" Immaru said smugly.\n\nEris ignored him and examined the staff she had crafted. It represented hours spent sliding a blade's edge over layers of dead, porous Hive chitin, carving it with spells and imbuing it with magic. At its head was soulfire ichor, encased in vitreous Light. A gleaming vessel.\n\n\"One last reagent.\"\n\nShe turned back to her worktable. The worm squirmed and squealed under her knife.",

Now it chimed as she turned it in her hands.\n\n\"Yeah, make it pretty,\" Immaru said, rolling his eye. \"That'll help. Real useful.\"\n\n\"I am binding the staff with my power,\" she said archly. \"What 'use' have you been?\"\n\n\"I told you what to do!\"\n\n\"I gathered the materials. I crafted the staff. I infused it with Light and soulfire. Do not presume your ideas were essential to this process.\"\n\n\"You think you're such an expert in Hive magic,\" Immaru scoffed, \"but you know what? You're just doing parlor tricks. Without me, that staff would be nothin' more than a fancy piece of bone.\"\n\nEris gripped the staff and held it out to test its heft. It was unbalanced. She returned it to the worktable.\n\n\"Do not make yourself intolerable.\"\n\nImmaru moved so he could look Eris in the face. She raised her eyes, staring him down. He came close; she did not step back.\n\n\"Or what? You might scare everyone else, but you don't scare me. There's nothin' you can do except put up with me.\"\n\nEris returned to her work, raising a hand and pushing him out of the way. He huffed, watching her as she resumed sharpening the points of the staff's base.\n\n\"With this, the Guardian may devise rituals of their own. It will empower their Light and channel the Hive's vile power.\"\n\n\"You're welcome,\" Immaru said smugly.\n\nEris ignored him and examined the staff she had crafted. It represented hours spent sliding a blade's edge over layers of dead, porous Hive chitin, carving it with spells and imbuing it with magic. At its head was soulfire ichor, encased in vitreous Light. A gleaming vessel.\n\n\"One last reagent.\"\n\nShe turned back to her worktable. The worm squirmed and squealed under her knife.",

Since her first choice was made from love?\"\n\nIkora responded as though she had not struggled with the thought a thousand times already. \"Eris will always be Eris, no matter what form she takes,\" she said.\n\nMithrax harrumphed in satisfaction and leaned forward to take another leech. \"Yes. I am always impressed with the resilience of the Guardians, with or without their Light. Saint tells me the Titan Sloane embraced the Taken, and she is doing well.\"\n\n\"Yes, and for that, I am grateful,\" Ikora said. \"But\u2026 they don't always come back, Mithrax. An old friend of mine was corrupted by the Vex in a similar way. He stayed behind when the Pyramids attacked, just like Sloane. But I believe we lost him.\"\n\n\"I am sorry about your friend,\" Mithrax said somberly. \"I hope he is remembered as a hero.\"\n\nIkora raised her eyebrows but said nothing.\n\n\"I, too, encountered a great mind consumed by the Vex,\" Mithrax continued. \"The Guardian and I attempted a rescue, but it went deeper into the network as it gained the access it sought. It taught me that the pursuit of truth is worth any price\u2014even one's own sense of self.\"\n\nIkora smiled. \"Asher would have agreed with every word of that.\"\n\nMithrax leaned forward in amazement, a leech dangling limply from his claws. \"You knew Ashermere?\"\n\nIkora cocked her head. \"Yes, Asher Mir. How on earth did you know him?\"\n\n\"Asher\u2026 Mir,\" Mithrax said slowly to himself, mimicking Ikora. \"That is why I have been unable to locate any records.\"\n\n\"Ikora,\" he said, straightening himself in his seat, \"I must tell you a story about our friend, Asher Mir, the hero.\"",

Immaru grumbled to himself.  \n\nFor as long as he'd been a Ghost, he'd resented how the Guardians referred to the Light. It was never \"my Ghost's Light\" or \"the Traveler's Light.\" No\u2014it was always \"MY Light.\" They talked about it like they owned it. Like they were entitled to it. Like they earned it. \n\nBut looking down at the smoldering battlefield, Immaru had to admit that the Guardians' arrogance served them well. It gave them the confidence to mold their Light in the fashion that suited them best. They treated it like a tool\u2014something to be used. That gave them an advantage over the Lucent Brood, whose manipulation of the Light was inhibited by reverence. \n\nImmaru turned away from the ritual circle in disgust.
