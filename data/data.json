The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

We'd talk all night and wake up with full memories of what we'd said. That was the first time I realized how powerful she'd become.\" \n\nPetra lowered her eyes. \"Of course, Pinar was Imar's favorite.

If I had, maybe I could still find Pinar out there, in a dream somewhere.\" She plucked a blade of grass from between the paving stones and tossed it into the breeze. \n\nAfter a pensive moment, Petra focused again on Ylaia. \"So, my suggestion is to give the training a chance.

They eyed each other warily, waiting for the other to strike.\n\nThe encircling throng of onlookers and bettors jostled unsteadily. Those at the back surged forward recklessly for a better view, while those in front struggled against the swell, afraid of being pushed into the path of the gladiators' swords. Audience casualties were common at such affairs.\n\nTagh'al suddenly broke the stalemate with a massive cleave, aimed at his opponent's helmeted head. Thagh'urn sidestepped it with ease. His ferocious counter-slice raked across Tagh'al's armored breastplate, leaving a thick gouge in the metal. The crowd roared.\n\nFor several minutes, the massive warriors clashed. Their swords clanged in fury, scraping off one another's armor. All the while, the crowd's furor grew, held in suspense by the certainty of bloodshed.\n\nThen it happened. As the two Cabal locked blades, Thagh'urn unholstered a concealed submachine gun. He unleashed a burst of small caliber bullets into Tagh'al's abdomen at point-blank range, sending the warrior staggering backward. Those who had bet on Tagh'al howled in indignation.\n\nTagh'al pulled off his breastplate to reveal several bullet holes in his thick hide, a gout of blood spurting from one of the wounds. He looked down at the damage\u2026\n\n\u2026And let out a deep, barking laugh. Thagh'urn joined in, and soon, both gladiators were laughing uproariously amidst a spreading pool of blood.\n\nEventually, Tagh'al's laugh slowed to a chuckle. \"Well played, brother,\" he said. \"I suppose we're even now.\"",

You too have done many things in your own life that revealed who you are.\n\nThe Guardians see me unrestrained. I do not control my emotions when I enter the oubliette and embrace my transformation. I warned you of this many years ago, when I was afraid of what I might do. But I am no longer afraid. The time for warnings has passed. We have the knowledge we need.\n\nLong ago I warned you of the threat Oryx posed and the imminence of his arrival. I spoke of his sword logic and his throne world, of his insatiable worm and the power of his Dreadnaught.\n\nWith this insight, you did something marvelous. Your throne world, your Eleusinia, is a testament to your will, to your Techeuns' skills, and to Riven's delight. Sadly, its desecration is, to our knowledge, irreparable. I am certain it was once beautiful.\n\nBut I believe it was also the sole exception in a process of creation that is uniquely Hive. If only the slaying of a powerful being was required, then every Guardian would be reveling in their own creation.\n\nRecall that it was only with Hive magic that the Scorned Baron Hiraks\u2014the Mindbender, as he wished to be styled\u2014created a throne through Cayde-6's murder. So, too, did Crota affect his own throne in the same way.\n\nOf course, Oryx and Savath\u00fbn's thrones are well-known to us. A worm-husk of bone; a lush garden of Light. Others have seen brief and terrible glimpses of Xivu Arath's throne. It gapes like a maw, following her wherever there is war.\n\nTheirs were inadvertent. Upon their first true deaths, they did not know what they had made. With their strength and the power of their worms, they created something dire, and found themselves there upon their deaths. Imagine the Hive gods' first glimpses of their realms. To retreat to one's throne is to retreat into the variances of one's mind. It is a stark confrontation.\n\nYou were well prepared for yours. Such was the consequence of my warning. I could well imagine my surprise at the variances of my own, as my own emotions surprise me now. But Imagining must be enough for me.\n\nEris Morn",
