The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

Torn flesh was barely acknowledged amidst the rising frenzy. \n\nIn the pit, two Revenants circled each other. One dragged a dented mace along the ground, gouging furrows into the dirt. The other brandished a rusted glaive of Awoken origin. \n\nThe Revenants swung their weapons in wild arcs, making no attempt to block the other's attacks. Their recent transformation had left them disoriented and uncoordinated. They knew only that they needed to destroy the once-familiar shape before them. \n\nAfter just a few seconds of haphazard swinging, the mace connected, caving in the left side of the Revenant's face with a wet crunch. The faceless combatant staggered around the ring, jabbing blindly, until their opponent brought the mace down on the back of their leg, sending them to the ground in a heap. \n\nThe spectators roared and descended upon the fallen Revenant, stabbing them wildly and ripping off bits of flesh. Soon only chunks and a greasy mist of Dark Ether remained. \n\nAs the frenzy abated, a sound filtered through the arena, drifting in from elsewhere in the fortress. It was light, fluid, and haunting. The Scorn slowed, and then stopped. Some swayed slightly as they tried to identify the noise. It was familiar, yet wholly novel. \n\nAs the sound grew louder, several of the newer Revenants began to moan. Others chittered. It was a deep, visceral response to something nearly-remembered. An intimation of what they had once been. \n\nSoon, the whole arena was rapt. The combat forgotten. And as the crowd swayed in harmony, the mace-wielding victor died, unnoticed, in the dirt.",

A long-range scout rifle slug punched through Krilix in the opening salvo, ripping a fist-sized hole in his chest. He fell on top of Vrisk in a heap of gore as a barrage of gunfire rained down on their position. \n\nVrisk could have shrugged off the Wretch's body and seized his Arc Spear to retaliate. Instead, he simply lay beneath his dying crewmate and let the battle play out. \n\nAfter the shooting stopped, Vrisk listened to their assailants ransack the ship. A mix of guttural Cabal barks and familiar Eliksni chatter marked them as a competing crew, eager to claim the bounty set forth by the reawakened Shipstealer.\n\nBut Vrisk knew what their attackers did not: the relic they sought was not on the Ketch, or even on this planet. It was hidden in a safehouse deep within the asteroid belt beyond Mars. Once Vrisk found the courage to emerge from his hiding place, he would take the relic to Eramiskel himself and claim the reward for his own.\n\nBut there was time for that. For now, the Dreg let the weight and warmth of his dead companion press him into a peaceful slumber, where he dreamed of better days to come.",

In the distance, atop the mesa, the setting sun kisses the parapets of Shaxx's castle, untouched by the violence in its shadow. Behind its walls, tendrils of smoke gently waft into the sky as the Ghostless under Shaxx's protection begin preparing the fires for their meals.\n\nSix Warlords arrived to conquer his stronghold. Five met their final death. \n\n\"Your Ghost,\" Shaxx repeats. He steps forward and crushes the Warlord's hand with his boot.\n\nThe Warlord cries out in pain, and all at once, the defiance leaves him like the breath in his lungs. His Ghost materializes, their eye fixated on Shaxx in fear.\n\nLord Shaxx shapes his Solar Light into a burning hammer, and in a single swing\u2014\n\nA clang of molten metal shakes him back to the present.\n\nOn the screen in front of him, a Guardian tosses her Hammer of Sol into the opposing team. Five erupt in flames as the lone survivor retreats.  The Guardian pursues.\n\nShaxx, without missing a beat, refocuses his attention on the Crucible match.\n\n\"Look at them fall!\" he shouts over the comms. \n\nA moment later, the Sunbreaker catches up to the last opponent and incinerates them. \n\nShaxx cheers her on as the smoke swallows his memories of a different time.",

It is a collection of Hive tomes on the nature of their runes and the rituals that they compose.\n\nI delved into the tomes immediately. They were very useful once I was able to decipher her notes, neaten the pages, and remove her blank bookmarks\u2014which I hope were not placed there for some purpose. I could not find a pattern to their insertion, even when they had arrows pointing to underlined passages.\n\nAt this point in my studies, I believe I have some insight into the way that these runes affect their magic. As Eris has explained to me, each rune is a logogram that encompasses many, and at times, contradictory meanings.  Curiously, some denote the particular Light energies used by Guardians and predate the acquisition of the Light by Savath\u00fbn's brood.\n\nThe style employed in inscribing the runes is unique to their practitioner. For instance, the runes that Eris writes follow concentric circles, while Savath\u00fbn composes long, tangential strings of runes. Runes also adorn many Hive weapons in long columns.\n\nI understand that Eris is now devising a ritual that requires the composition and empowerment of many Hive runes. I must remember to wish her luck.",

She tooled the rifling in her barrels with the steady hand of an artisan. Her dyes, cobalt and ichor, shone bright as beetleshell.\n\nThe other, Gharhet, came from the distant plains. He traded for his wares and sold them dear, and thus he amassed great wealth. He embellished his goods with a rich lacquer the color of flame.\n\nWhen the Primus called for the strongest warriors to serve, the district knew the fighter Tlamus\u2014who had broken all challengers with her keen aim and powerful frame\u2014would represent them. Both Dhutus and Gharhet wished to outfit her with their finest pieces, as having a warrior of her status wear their colors would bring them great honor.\n\nSo Dhutus forged Tlamus a mighty war axe with an ice-blue handle and wide golden blade. Tlamus accepted the gift gladly.\n\nGharhet procured for her a Slug Rifle with bright orange plating, and Tlamus wore it proudly across her back.\n\nNext, Dhutus crafted a Shotgun, metal burnished deep as night with bright vents along the sides, and Tlamus brought it into battle.\n\nIn response, Gharhet bought a helm with thick plating and stout antlers the color of a sunset, and they were soon stained with the blood of Tlamus's foes.\n\nAnd Dhutus saw no end to this. Her shoulders ached from working the forge, and her hands were blistered by burns upon burns.\n\nSo Dhutus issued to Gharhet a challenge, and as he knew no one would raise the weapons of a coward, Gharhet accepted.\n\nThe next dawn found Dhutus on the battlefield waiting for her rival. On her shoulder was her finest weapon: a Rocket Launcher, its barrel a twisting column of seashell blue with gold trim, built as a gift for Tlamus but now wielded by its creator.\n\nFrom across the field, a figure strode forward to meet Dhutus\u2014but it was too wide to be Gharhet; too tall, too muscular. He had bought a champion to fight in his stead.\n\nAn orange sash was draped carelessly across her chest and dragged in the dust with each confident step. Studded orange leathers bound her massive arms and thighs. Strands of coral beads hung from her tusks.\n\nShe greeted Dhutus with a fist to her chest. \"I am Tlamus,\" she said, \"chosen of Gharhet.\"\n\nDhutus could not find her voice, and then Tlamus drew one of her beautiful, terrible weapons, and the rite was soon concluded.",

In fact, I have just finished going over my notes!\n\nThe old crews rose in the wake of the Whirlwind, during what we Eliksni refer to as the Long Drift\u2014the span of time between the fall of Riis and our arrival in the Sol system. I believe the equivalent period would be your Dark Ages, though Riis did not have Risen, or Iron Lords. Instead, we had the crews. As you can imagine, this period was quite lawless, as the stability and abundance of Riis was no more. This resulted in what I believe is called a zero-sum game: a situation in which every gain or advantage is earned at the expense of another. \n\nSeveral fearsome individuals rose to great power and authoritative prominence at that time; the Eliksni word for them translates to \"Ketchkiller,\" meaning one who boards and wrests control of enemy ships. These Ketchkillers commanded great fleets and raided many supply routes, procuring objects of historic or intrinsic value along the way. It is exciting to wonder what treasures they accumulated beyond those we've recovered already!\n\nMany crews were abolished or disbanded over time, but those that survived did so through great hardship\u2014they are formidable indeed. But then, so is the Vanguard, and its Guardians.\n\nThank you for asking about my research into the old crews and their significance. It is always a pleasure to talk about it.

It is a good question, and one that many Eliksni do not think on often enough.\n\nFor Humans, a house is a place. But for Eliksni, a House is a family. It has a culture. A philosophy of living, shared by all.\n\nThat is why the House of Light survived, even when we fled Europa. Even after the Shipstealer took all we had. We were bound not by place or possessions, but as family.\n\nCryptarch Matsuo asked me why the old crews are not considered Houses. It is a wise question. One that, perhaps, does not have a singular answer. \n\nI think it is because those who lead the old crews do not wish to be true Kells. A Kell is responsible for the safety and prosperity of their House. It is an honor, and a burden.\n\nThose you call Pirate Lords wish only to take\u2014they give nothing, even to their own people.

In fact, I have just finished going over my notes!\n\nThe old crews rose in the wake of the Whirlwind, during what we Eliksni refer to as the Long Drift\u2014the span of time between the fall of Riis and our arrival in the Sol system. I believe the equivalent period would be your Dark Ages, though Riis did not have Risen, or Iron Lords. Instead, we had the crews. As you can imagine, this period was quite lawless, as the stability and abundance of Riis was no more. This resulted in what I believe is called a zero-sum game: a situation in which every gain or advantage is earned at the expense of another. \n\nSeveral fearsome individuals rose to great power and authoritative prominence at that time; the Eliksni word for them translates to \"Ketchkiller,\" meaning one who boards and wrests control of enemy ships. These Ketchkillers commanded great fleets and raided many supply routes, procuring objects of historic or intrinsic value along the way. It is exciting to wonder what treasures they accumulated beyond those we've recovered already!\n\nMany crews were abolished or disbanded over time, but those that survived did so through great hardship\u2014they are formidable indeed. But then, so is the Vanguard, and its Guardians.\n\nThank you for asking about my research into the old crews and their significance. It is always a pleasure to talk about it. After all, what use is knowledge if it is not shared?",

In fact, I have just finished going over my notes!\n\nThe old crews rose in the wake of the Whirlwind, during what we Eliksni refer to as the Long Drift\u2014the span of time between the fall of Riis and our arrival in the Sol system. I believe the equivalent period would be your Dark Ages, though Riis did not have Risen, or Iron Lords. Instead, we had the crews. As you can imagine, this period was quite lawless, as the stability and abundance of Riis was no more. This resulted in what I believe is called a zero-sum game: a situation in which every gain or advantage is earned at the expense of another. \n\nSeveral fearsome individuals rose to great power and authoritative prominence at that time; the Eliksni word for them translates to \"Ketchkiller,\" meaning one who boards and wrests control of enemy ships. These Ketchkillers commanded great fleets and raided many supply routes, procuring objects of historic or intrinsic value along the way. It is exciting to wonder what treasures they accumulated beyond those we've recovered already!\n\nMany crews were abolished or disbanded over time, but those that survived did so through great hardship\u2014they are formidable indeed. But then, so is the Vanguard, and its Guardians.\n\nThank you for asking about my research into the old crews and their significance. It is always a pleasure to talk about it. After all, what use is knowledge if it is not shared?",

Ain't much I can tell you that you couldn't get from Rahool, but I can't blame you if you'd rather stay awake for the whole story, heheh. C'mon, loosen up, hero! If you think a grim expression is all it takes to move up through the Vanguard\u2026 well, you may have something there.\n\nOkay, I'll start at the beginning. The Traveler chose the Eliksni and everything was great over in Riis, until it wasn't. The Whirlwind happened, the Pyramids showed up, the Traveler took off through space, and from what I gather, it wasn't a pretty scene. \n\nEramis was there for it. And\u2014credit where it's due\u2014she picked herself up, grabbed a crew, and went after the Traveler. She cut through everything in her way, dead set on hunting it down. \n\nAnd she wasn't the only one with that idea. Whole fleets of ships chased the Traveler. Lawless days. Hopeless days. \n\n\u2026See, I was here for the Dark Ages. And when there's nothing but loss around you planetside, you can still find a rooftop, sit in a snowfield. You can go into a forest and find a moment of quiet\u2014a little scrap of peace.\n\nAin't like that on a ship. Things go from bad to worse, you just have to face it. And Eramis did. That takes a gutful of grit.\n\nNow, don't think I'm writin' love poems to the Shipstealer over here\u2014we find her, I'm drawing down quick as you are. \n\nBut if the big old Traveler blasted outta the sky tomorrow? You bet your entire vault we'd chase after it. We'd be the new crews, going after something we knew in our bones was ours, not stopping for anyone or anything that got in our way.\n\nAnd we'd still think of ourselves as heroes, wouldn't we?",
