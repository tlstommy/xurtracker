The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

Some say it sounds like a scream you hear in your bones. Others say it sounds like a dying star.

Or mysterious, freaky signals.\" \n\n\"Vanguard will be along in a few to see us off.\" Roche-5's composed baritone emerges from the hatch leading to the cargo hold. \"You two ready?\" \n\n Rahila settles into the copilot's chair. \"To go find out what's left of our solar system?

After Empress Caiatl's announcement, every Legionnaire in the land tank had come to jealously salute him for his promotion. It was the appointment of a lifetime. \n\nDeep within the Halphas Electus, Ignovun oversaw his arena's preparation. There was the hanging of Caiatl's banners, the anointing of his ammunition, and the intonement of the Litany of the Chosen by an imperial mythkeeper. He was fitted for new armor that gleamed in the light. He was briefed on the protocols of the Rite, and the expectations of his victory. \n\nBut now, alone in the arena, doubt creeps into Ignovun's thoughts. Ghaul believed that the strength of the smallmen was their Light. He reasoned that the power of the Traveler, like any weapon, could be stripped from the enemy and used against them. Clearly, he was wrong. \n\nIgnovun believes differently. Their strength comes not from Light, but from death. The Guardians are already walking corpses, and yet they fight on. They have all died a thousand times, while Ignovun has yet to die even once. How can he defeat an opponent whom death cannot best? \n\nSuddenly, the treacherous ravings of Ixel, the Far-Reaching did not seem so absurd. If the Cabal are to triumph over the smallmen, they will have to succeed where Ghaul failed. They will have to bring mortality to the Vanguard. \n\nIgnovun knows that these musings will not save him. But he does not fear: if the smallmen can face death, then so can he.",

In fact, I have just finished going over my notes!\n\nThe old crews rose in the wake of the Whirlwind, during what we Eliksni refer to as the Long Drift\u2014the span of time between the fall of Riis and our arrival in the Sol system. I believe the equivalent period would be your Dark Ages, though Riis did not have Risen, or Iron Lords. Instead, we had the crews. As you can imagine, this period was quite lawless, as the stability and abundance of Riis was no more. This resulted in what I believe is called a zero-sum game: a situation in which every gain or advantage is earned at the expense of another. \n\nSeveral fearsome individuals rose to great power and authoritative prominence at that time; the Eliksni word for them translates to \"Ketchkiller,\" meaning one who boards and wrests control of enemy ships. These Ketchkillers commanded great fleets and raided many supply routes, procuring objects of historic or intrinsic value along the way. It is exciting to wonder what treasures they accumulated beyond those we've recovered already!\n\nMany crews were abolished or disbanded over time, but those that survived did so through great hardship\u2014they are formidable indeed. But then, so is the Vanguard, and its Guardians.\n\nThank you for asking about my research into the old crews and their significance. It is always a pleasure to talk about it. After all, what use is knowledge if it is not shared?",

If you think a grim expression is all it takes to move up through the Vanguard\u2026 well, you may have something there.\n\nOkay, I'll start at the beginning. The Traveler chose the Eliksni and everything was great over in Riis, until it wasn't. The Whirlwind happened, the Pyramids showed up, the Traveler took off through space, and from what I gather, it wasn't a pretty scene. \n\nEramis was there for it. And\u2014credit where it's due\u2014she picked herself up, grabbed a crew, and went after the Traveler. She cut through everything in her way, dead set on hunting it down. \n\nAnd she wasn't the only one with that idea. Whole fleets of ships chased the Traveler. Lawless days. Hopeless days. \n\n\u2026See, I was here for the Dark Ages. And when there's nothing but loss around you planetside, you can still find a rooftop, sit in a snowfield. You can go into a forest and find a moment of quiet\u2014a little scrap of peace.\n\nAin't like that on a ship. Things go from bad to worse, you just have to face it. And Eramis did. That takes a gutful of grit.\n\nNow, don't think I'm writin' love poems to the Shipstealer over here\u2014we find her, I'm drawing down quick as you are. \n\nBut if the big old Traveler blasted outta the sky tomorrow? You bet your entire vault we'd chase after it. We'd be the new crews, going after something we knew in our bones was ours, not stopping for anyone or anything that got in our way.\n\nAnd we'd still think of ourselves as heroes, wouldn't we?",

In fact, I have just finished going over my notes!\n\nThe old crews rose in the wake of the Whirlwind, during what we Eliksni refer to as the Long Drift\u2014the span of time between the fall of Riis and our arrival in the Sol system. I believe the equivalent period would be your Dark Ages, though Riis did not have Risen, or Iron Lords. Instead, we had the crews. As you can imagine, this period was quite lawless, as the stability and abundance of Riis was no more. This resulted in what I believe is called a zero-sum game: a situation in which every gain or advantage is earned at the expense of another. \n\nSeveral fearsome individuals rose to great power and authoritative prominence at that time; the Eliksni word for them translates to \"Ketchkiller,\" meaning one who boards and wrests control of enemy ships. These Ketchkillers commanded great fleets and raided many supply routes, procuring objects of historic or intrinsic value along the way. It is exciting to wonder what treasures they accumulated beyond those we've recovered already!\n\nMany crews were abolished or disbanded over time, but those that survived did so through great hardship\u2014they are formidable indeed. But then, so is the Vanguard, and its Guardians.\n\nThank you for asking about my research into the old crews and their significance. It is always a pleasure to talk about it. After all, what use is knowledge if it is not shared?",

Ain't much I can tell you that you couldn't get from Rahool, but I can't blame you if you'd rather stay awake for the whole story, heheh. C'mon, loosen up, hero! If you think a grim expression is all it takes to move up through the Vanguard\u2026 well, you may have something there.\n\nOkay, I'll start at the beginning. The Traveler chose the Eliksni and everything was great over in Riis, until it wasn't. The Whirlwind happened, the Pyramids showed up, the Traveler took off through space, and from what I gather, it wasn't a pretty scene. \n\nEramis was there for it. And\u2014credit where it's due\u2014she picked herself up, grabbed a crew, and went after the Traveler. She cut through everything in her way, dead set on hunting it down. \n\nAnd she wasn't the only one with that idea. Whole fleets of ships chased the Traveler. Lawless days. Hopeless days. \n\n\u2026See, I was here for the Dark Ages. And when there's nothing but loss around you planetside, you can still find a rooftop, sit in a snowfield. You can go into a forest and find a moment of quiet\u2014a little scrap of peace.\n\nAin't like that on a ship. Things go from bad to worse, you just have to face it. And Eramis did. That takes a gutful of grit.\n\nNow, don't think I'm writin' love poems to the Shipstealer over here\u2014we find her, I'm drawing down quick as you are. \n\nBut if the big old Traveler blasted outta the sky tomorrow? You bet your entire vault we'd chase after it. We'd be the new crews, going after something we knew in our bones was ours, not stopping for anyone or anything that got in our way.\n\nAnd we'd still think of ourselves as heroes, wouldn't we?",

In fact, I have just finished going over my notes!\n\nThe old crews rose in the wake of the Whirlwind, during what we Eliksni refer to as the Long Drift\u2014the span of time between the fall of Riis and our arrival in the Sol system. I believe the equivalent period would be your Dark Ages, though Riis did not have Risen, or Iron Lords. Instead, we had the crews. As you can imagine, this period was quite lawless, as the stability and abundance of Riis was no more. This resulted in what I believe is called a zero-sum game: a situation in which every gain or advantage is earned at the expense of another. \n\nSeveral fearsome individuals rose to great power and authoritative prominence at that time; the Eliksni word for them translates to \"Ketchkiller,\" meaning one who boards and wrests control of enemy ships. These Ketchkillers commanded great fleets and raided many supply routes, procuring objects of historic or intrinsic value along the way. It is exciting to wonder what treasures they accumulated beyond those we've recovered already!\n\nMany crews were abolished or disbanded over time, but those that survived did so through great hardship\u2014they are formidable indeed. But then, so is the Vanguard, and its Guardians.\n\nThank you for asking about my research into the old crews and their significance. It is always a pleasure to talk about it. After all, what use is knowledge if it is not shared?",

Ain't much I can tell you that you couldn't get from Rahool, but I can't blame you if you'd rather stay awake for the whole story, heheh. C'mon, loosen up, hero! If you think a grim expression is all it takes to move up through the Vanguard\u2026 well, you may have something there.\n\nOkay, I'll start at the beginning. The Traveler chose the Eliksni and everything was great over in Riis, until it wasn't. The Whirlwind happened, the Pyramids showed up, the Traveler took off through space, and from what I gather, it wasn't a pretty scene. \n\nEramis was there for it. And\u2014credit where it's due\u2014she picked herself up, grabbed a crew, and went after the Traveler. She cut through everything in her way, dead set on hunting it down. \n\nAnd she wasn't the only one with that idea. Whole fleets of ships chased the Traveler. Lawless days. Hopeless days. \n\n\u2026See, I was here for the Dark Ages. And when there's nothing but loss around you planetside, you can still find a rooftop, sit in a snowfield. You can go into a forest and find a moment of quiet\u2014a little scrap of peace.\n\nAin't like that on a ship. Things go from bad to worse, you just have to face it. And Eramis did. That takes a gutful of grit.\n\nNow, don't think I'm writin' love poems to the Shipstealer over here\u2014we find her, I'm drawing down quick as you are. \n\nBut if the big old Traveler blasted outta the sky tomorrow? You bet your entire vault we'd chase after it. We'd be the new crews, going after something we knew in our bones was ours, not stopping for anyone or anything that got in our way.\n\nAnd we'd still think of ourselves as heroes, wouldn't we?",

It is a good question, and one that many Eliksni do not think on often enough.\n\nFor Humans, a house is a place. But for Eliksni, a House is a family. It has a culture. A philosophy of living, shared by all.\n\nThat is why the House of Light survived, even when we fled Europa. Even after the Shipstealer took all we had. We were bound not by place or possessions, but as family.\n\nCryptarch Matsuo asked me why the old crews are not considered Houses. It is a wise question. One that, perhaps, does not have a singular answer. \n\nI think it is because those who lead the old crews do not wish to be true Kells. A Kell is responsible for the safety and prosperity of their House. It is an honor, and a burden.\n\nThose you call Pirate Lords wish only to take\u2014they give nothing, even to their own people.
