The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

Then another, followed immediately by a third. And finally, a full-blown Ketch de-cloaked above their position. There were but three of them to protect a hundred who had once been thrice that. Within minutes, it was only her.\n\nShe corralled the survivors into a cave that once upon a time wasn't a cave but more of an industrial drainage system. It was foul here; the radiation was practically palpable, and the survivors\u2014if they survived this day\u2014would likely find their lives shortened by years if not decades thanks to this poisoned solace.\n\nShe pushed them forward, deeper into the underground, as fast as they could manage. She carried two children, both eerily silent and unaffected. They, like their people, had endured more than she could imagine in their five-thousand kilometer exodus. They had given up their homes for the promise of something better. For the promise of hope and light and the strength of the pack. In their quest for better lives, they had lost almost everything.\n\nHer Ghost told her the bad news\u2014this cave system was a labyrinth extending dozens of kilometers with more dead-ends than not. The walls were deeply reinforced, and its scans could see but half a kilometer at best. It was going to be trial and error, and their pursuers were getting closer. Her Ghost didn't think they would make it. Not before\u2026\n\nOne of the children in her arms\u2014a little girl whose name was Violet\u2014looked her in the eye and told her, without a hint of doubt, that she knew her Guardian would let nothing happen to them. Not after how far they'd come. She smiled at Violet and told her, yes, everything was going to be okay.\n\nShe set the children down, told them to run ahead and join the others; she would be right behind them. Alone with her Ghost, she told it to lead them to safety. She would stay behind and buy them time. And by the Traveler's Light, it would be an eternity's worth.\n\nAnd so, reluctantly, her Ghost floated ahead to rejoin the exodus, but not before swearing it would come back to find her and bring her back, no matter how long it took.\n\nWith the light of her Ghost now out of sight and the soft wet steps of a hundred refugees out of ear-shot, she strapped on her helmet, tightened her gauntlets, and drew a line in the muck beneath her feet. When the chittering of Fallen Dregs finally began to echo through the tunnels, she reached for the Light and with it crafted a shield of Void energy.\n\nIf need be, she would hold this line until the end of time.",

Dim and exhausted Motes lie scattered throughout the Derelict, slowly evaporating. She retrieves a Mote from the floor and shines her burning light over the cracked surface. The light struggles to leave the cracks. She lets the disintegrating Mote drop and shatter into dust against the floor grates. It chimes like resonate glass.\n\nThe Drifter whirls around to face the noise, almost losing his footing. He lets his hand slide off his holstered Trust as recognition washes over him. \"Ain't anybody ever tell you not to skulk? It's rude.\"\n\n\"Noted. Are you vacating?\"\n\n\"Road trip. How'd you get in here anyway?\"\n\n\"The airlock was open.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"If I said I were here to run in your rat race, would it change your tune?\"\n\n\"Uh huh\u2026\"\n\nEris drops her shoulders and approaches the Drifter. \"I want your help.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\" His brow furrows with suspicion. \"Why? Didn't you save the universe yet?\" Drifter turns back to shoving bags in bags.\n\n\"It seems to be continually in peril. To be honest, I'm not sure I've helped.\"\n\nEris hands him a bag. \"I need your knowledge.\"\n\n\"You? No.\"\n\n\"I have had some troubling experiences as of late.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's called life.\"\n\n\"I need to know,\" she says and hesitates, half-hearted restraint preceding sacrilege. \"Tell me how to interpret the Darkness.\"\n\n\"What am I, some crusty woo-woo sage? Beat it, kid. I'm packing.\"\n\n\"Do not ignore me,\" Eris says. Her voice is calm and piercing. \"We've both seen beneath the surface.\"\n\nDrifter drops the pack in his hand and picks a jade coin off his workbench.\n\n\"Asher is entrenched in his thinking,\" she says and gently places a palm down on the workbench beside them. \"Ikora\u2026 she tries. She hears, but she doesn't understand. No one is listening.\"\n\nDrifter pockets the coin and turns to face her. He stares deep. \"Experience. Hell of a thing.\" He looks down the gangway of the Derelict and through the gate that would take him to his Haul. \"Favors ain't free. I do this, you owe me.\"\n\nEris nods. Drifter swipes the workbench clean and pulls out a retractable seat for himself.\n\n\"How long you got?\"\n\nThe two sit. They speak. They listen. Linkages forged in Light and Dark of traded secrets as the Derelict hangs in orbit around the Earth. Pacts are made. Soon, there is only the silence of knowing left between them.\n\n\"Next time you fly over the Moon, dust your boots. Tracking that crap all over my floors.\"\n\nEris shakes her head and moves toward the airlock.\n\nDrifter yells after her, \"AND CALL NEXT TIME! I could've blown those fancy eyes straight out of your face.\"\n\n\"I'll try to be more mindful of your many eccentricities in the future.\"",

We may not have all the answers, but here's what we know:\n\nRemote scans of the \"Endless Night\" either failed to return data or returned contradictory data; this behavior suggested an emittance of electromagnetic disruption, which indicated that this is more than a simulation projected over the City. Confirmation of this disruption has occurred as every probe sent into the clouds, even shielded ones, experienced acute electrical overload within seconds.\n\nNow having confirmed the existence of the EM field, we have reached a new hypothesis in our reevaluation of our initial scans. We believe that we are not, in fact, receiving contradictory data\u2026 but a scrambling of our own scans, rewritten with new information.\n\nThese scans are subsequently being bounced back to us and are infiltrating our systems via rooting programs masquerading as collected data. Anyone wondering how they've managed to shut down our power distribution and water purification facilities without firing a shot needs look no further. They set a trap, and we sprang it. This information absolutely must be aired to the rest of the Consensus.\n\nSome of my colleagues believe the actual \"night\" visualization is meant to be a means of psychological warfare. Whether that is intended or not is unclear, though there has undoubtedly been an effect on the population, as reports of illness and sleep loss have spiked considerably.\n\nI've moved to cease all data collection, but I have repeatedly been overridden by higher clearances. I must, again, recommend that we sever all connections and terminate any data collection sweeps. We're digging our own graves, otherwise.\n\nWhatever executive still has that uplink running, knock it off. You're playing with fire here.\n\n\u2014FWC R&D Head, Arsha Saad",

Delete this footnote upon the rectification of this error. +\n\n+ Note from Scribe Savat: I see no reason for Scribe Shagac's harshness.
