The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

Let us rekindle our friendship.\"\n\n\"\u2026Magistrate? What happened?\"\n\n\"I am Empyreal Magistrate no longer. I have not been for many years. I lost my Ghost, and so\u2026 my Light. With it went the Forge.\"\n\n\"But, Magistrate\u2014\"\n\n\"No. No, that title belongs to another now. You must seek them out. Gather the other Sunbreakers, and choose a new Magistrate. The Order has lacked leadership for too long. Bring them together, Ouros.\n\n\"Heat is a force that breaks bonds, shatters structure, separates elements. Heat liquefies solids, and in turn transforms them to aether. In this way, it is a force of chaos and destruction. It even tears the universe apart. In a way, it tore apart our Order.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"The fire that burns within you\u2014that rage, that wrath\u2014it explodes outward upon foes. Incinerates. Destroys. But that is not all. What happens when you burn yourself or your friends?\"\n\n\"Burn myself or\u2026? The ring of flames. In it, my enemies burn, and yet my allies can walk through that fire, untouched.\"\n\n\"Yes! But for you it is more. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"Yes. I feel stronger inside the circle.\"\n\n\"Exactly. But the grace of Solar Light was never meant to be ours alone. In the beginning, Sunbreakers could share the warmth of the fire within. Friends that walked in the circle felt that warmth too.\"\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"The ring of flames was a judge, granting only weal or woe. Too many who carried the Light were burned by the heat of the fire. That was part of why we Sunbreakers could not abide so-called civilization.\n\n\"Leaving wasn't easy. Not all in the Order thought it the right path. Despite the good we could do in the wilds, there was disagreement, judgement. More bonds broken than made.\n\n\"Little by little, we all lost something. Sharing the warmth of our fires with others just became\u2026 too hard. The method became a secret, and the secret became a mystery.\n\n\"Find the others. Choose an Empyreal Magistrate. Find a way to share your fire. I am too old and have no fire left to share.\"\n\n\"No, Aodh. Your shoulder warms mine, too. Your words kindle a new fire in me. We'll spread the flames together. And we'll find a way share the warmth again.\"\n\n\"But I am too old. I am blind. I have no Light.\"\n\n\"You've seen more than me, and your vision is so clear, it opened my eyes. You are not shadowed by a Ghost, but you're as bright as the Sun.\"\n\n\"For one who says so little, you have a fine way with words. Perhaps we won't have to go too far to find a new Empyreal Magistrate.\"",

                "ExtLore": "Titan fell into darkness only moments before the first Tomb-craft arrived. They bore the burning sigils of War, dripping soulfire from their branded hulls as if it gushed from an open wound.  \n\nBeneath the churning sea, a Guardian Light wrapped in metal, yet to be coiled in promise, watched the skies turn to ink, and Hive fiends disembark the invading craft. \n\nProclamations scattered across the methane ocean, eager words searing each wave's crest with jade flame. The Hive's intent was clear: tear asunder the claims of the Witch Sister. Raise the banners of War. \n\nLed by a massive Knight, Acolytes descended to depths once infested by denizens of the lie, down to where the song of trickery echoed from long-dead shrieks. They marched in adorant procession, surrounded by a host of Thralls that defaced the remnant traces of Savath\u00fbn's holdings with hungering delight. \n\nHeld aloft in the claws of a central Acolyte was a Wizard's skull, recovered from the flame-licked wash before Titan's capture. The Acolyte delicately placed the skull upon a ragged sheet of conquered foe-flesh while others carved a circle of runes around it. \n\nThe Acolytes took position over the runes. They threw their heads back and howled a discordant melody that ignited the rune-circle, consuming each of them in soulfire conflagration. \n\nThe melody took hold, flooding the flesh of the accompanying Thralls with frenzy. They surged forward, kicked and clawed their kin in a mad scramble to reach the skull first. To claim it. \n\nEach time the melody thrummed, an Acolyte turned to ash. Each time the melody thrummed, spilled Thrall viscera twisted into fetid swirls around the skull. \n\nBlood and ash was offered until none remained; the Knight stepped forward, brandishing a blade of deathly menace. \n\n\"I call Xivu Arath. I invoke War's presence. Take this dreg, cast out by your sister. Take her claims as your own.\" \n\nThe churning soulflame was drawn into the Knight's deathly blade, then plunged into the Wizard's skull. The runic circle projected an ancient realm, and the Knight felt watchful eyes leering from atop a distant Black Terrace perched above that projected realm. The thunderous response pressed him to his knees. \n\nKELGORATH, I ACCEPT THINE OFFERINGS \n\nTHROUGH WILL, LIES ARE UNEARTHED \n\nTHROUGH WILL, LIES ARE MADE TRUTH \n\nTHROUGH WILL, LIES FALL TO CONQUEST \n\n KUDAZAD, BOUND, YOU ARE NAMED IN SERVICE",

You too have done many things in your own life that revealed who you are.\n\nThe Guardians see me unrestrained. I do not control my emotions when I enter the oubliette and embrace my transformation. I warned you of this many years ago, when I was afraid of what I might do. But I am no longer afraid. The time for warnings has passed. We have the knowledge we need.\n\nLong ago I warned you of the threat Oryx posed and the imminence of his arrival. I spoke of his sword logic and his throne world, of his insatiable worm and the power of his Dreadnaught.\n\nWith this insight, you did something marvelous. Your throne world, your Eleusinia, is a testament to your will, to your Techeuns' skills, and to Riven's delight. Sadly, its desecration is, to our knowledge, irreparable. I am certain it was once beautiful.\n\nBut I believe it was also the sole exception in a process of creation that is uniquely Hive. If only the slaying of a powerful being was required, then every Guardian would be reveling in their own creation.\n\nRecall that it was only with Hive magic that the Scorned Baron Hiraks\u2014the Mindbender, as he wished to be styled\u2014created a throne through Cayde-6's murder. So, too, did Crota affect his own throne in the same way.\n\nOf course, Oryx and Savath\u00fbn's thrones are well-known to us. A worm-husk of bone; a lush garden of Light. Others have seen brief and terrible glimpses of Xivu Arath's throne. It gapes like a maw, following her wherever there is war.\n\nTheirs were inadvertent. Upon their first true deaths, they did not know what they had made. With their strength and the power of their worms, they created something dire, and found themselves there upon their deaths. Imagine the Hive gods' first glimpses of their realms. To retreat to one's throne is to retreat into the variances of one's mind. It is a stark confrontation.\n\nYou were well prepared for yours. Such was the consequence of my warning. I could well imagine my surprise at the variances of my own, as my own emotions surprise me now. But Imagining must be enough for me.\n\nEris Morn",

If anything, it's good for a laugh. Don't let our favorite Praxic wear you down to a nub. If she gives you grief, you give her a swift kick from me. \u2014C.Y.\n\n[Attached transcript.]\n\n\n\nRECORD: 30.10.15.C.Y.Report\nIDENTITIES: Advisor Taurun [A.T.], Empress Caiatl [E.C.], The Spider [T.S.]\nFILE//HID_CLASSIFIED//AUDIO\n\n[A.T.] The connection is made. Let the imperial record show that, on this day, the great Empress Caiatl, ascendant of Calus, slayer of Umun'arath, convened via radio message with the Spider of the Tangled Shore, formerly of the House of\u2014\n\n[E.C.] Enough, Taurun. The scribes can add whatever flourishes they wish after the fact.\n\n[T.S.] Yes, let's not waste time. I know you have more important matters to attend to. Matters that I would be happy to help with\u2026 in my own small way.\n\n[E.C.] I would no sooner seek aid from you than a war beast would from a bog-tick. Do you know how many thieves I've had to excise from my ranks? They debased themselves. Crawling about our proving grounds. Refashioning battle-trash into weapons. All because you tempted them with a flash of Glimmer.\n\n[T.S.] Ha! Me? Tempt them? It's all I can do to keep them from flooding the market.\n\n[E.C.] This is not my first time dealing with war profiteers, insect. Though, if I squash you thoroughly enough, it may be my last.\n\n[T.S.] And here I thought I was doing you a charity, promoting Cabal entrepreneurship. I was told the empire was low on funds.\n\n[E.C.] Is that so?\n\n[T.S.] Your Majesty, I don't know what advice you've been getting from your imperial hangers-on, but\u2014\n\n[A.T.] How dare you\u2014\n\n[E.C.] Quiet.\n\n[T.S.] But things are different here in the Sol system. Smash and conquer\u2014like so many traditions of old Torobatl\u2014won't get you far. Ghaul found that out the hard way. The remnants of his Red Legion have learned to adapt.\n\n[T.S.] Let me know if you'd like to do the same. I'd even go against my own custom and consider a payment plan.\n\n[E.C.] How generous. But it seems I have no need. As you've revealed, I have untapped resources at my disposal.\n\n[T.S.] Whichever ones have survived your purge, yes. But weapons are not my most valuable wares, not by a long shot. If you're anything like your father, you'll be far more interested in the information I have to offer.\n\n[E.C.] Send your coordinates. We can discuss face-to-face. But tread lightly. I've yet to decide whether you're worth my mercy.\n\n[T.S.] Oh, I'm honored to host Her Imperial Highness on my humble Shore. It's no palatial estate, but we insects are just happy to have a place to call home.\n\n[End transmission.]",

We may not have all the answers, but here's what we know:\n\nRemote scans of the \"Endless Night\" either failed to return data or returned contradictory data; this behavior suggested an emittance of electromagnetic disruption, which indicated that this is more than a simulation projected over the City. Confirmation of this disruption has occurred as every probe sent into the clouds, even shielded ones, experienced acute electrical overload within seconds.\n\nNow having confirmed the existence of the EM field, we have reached a new hypothesis in our reevaluation of our initial scans. We believe that we are not, in fact, receiving contradictory data\u2026 but a scrambling of our own scans, rewritten with new information.\n\nThese scans are subsequently being bounced back to us and are infiltrating our systems via rooting programs masquerading as collected data. Anyone wondering how they've managed to shut down our power distribution and water purification facilities without firing a shot needs look no further. They set a trap, and we sprang it. This information absolutely must be aired to the rest of the Consensus.\n\nSome of my colleagues believe the actual \"night\" visualization is meant to be a means of psychological warfare. Whether that is intended or not is unclear, though there has undoubtedly been an effect on the population, as reports of illness and sleep loss have spiked considerably.\n\nI've moved to cease all data collection, but I have repeatedly been overridden by higher clearances. I must, again, recommend that we sever all connections and terminate any data collection sweeps. We're digging our own graves, otherwise.\n\nWhatever executive still has that uplink running, knock it off. You're playing with fire here.\n\n\u2014FWC R&D Head, Arsha Saad",
