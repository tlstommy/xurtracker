The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

She'd never been to this corner of the City before.\n\n\"Mom?\" she called doubtfully, hearing her voice echo in the empty space.\n\n\"Back here,\" answered her mother, and Helena's stomach dropped.\n\nShe pulled open a rusty door and found her mother in a low concrete room, frantically packing the contents of a long table into duffel bags. Along the far wall, another woman was balling up a plastic tarp. The room smelled like chemicals.\n\nA man shouldering a large black bag pushed his way past her in a cloud of cologne, alcohol, and sour sweat.\n\nHelena noticed a small signal jammer blinking orange on the table. Behind it, an Exo was waist-deep in a rebar-lined fracture in the floor.\n\n\"Tight fit,\" he grunted as he wriggled his way deeper into the gap, \"but I'm guessing he didn't get far. I'll find him.\" He vanished into the hole.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Helena asked.\n\n\"Don't ask questions,\" her mother said as she shrugged a damp strand of blonde hair out of her face. \"We need to get moving.\" She nodded toward the far corner of the room. \"You take that pile.\"\n\nHelena crossed her arms warily. \"Mom, what are you doing out here?\"\n\n\"I don't have time to talk about this now,\" her mother snapped. \"You don't know what's going on. You didn't see them looking through the windows. You didn't hear what this one said in the ramen shop.\"\n\nFor the first time, her mother looked up. Dangerous intensity burned in her eyes. \"They're using the dark to blind us, and we're not going to let it happen. Now help me.\"\n\nHelena walked slowly to the trash piled in the corner. Towels soaked with blue fluid. Rubbery tubes, strange scraps of metal. A laminated card that read \"TEMPORARY.\"\n\nHer voice was small. \"Mama, what did you do?\"",
