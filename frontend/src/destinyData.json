The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

Between the Vanguard's support, generous contributions from the Awoken, and several upgrades courtesy of a lapsed Dead Orbit adherent, the ship's a lot to be entrusted with. \n\n\"These new sensors are something else,\" Isidro announces from the cockpit. \"If so much as a mouse sneezes out there in the black, we'll pick it up.\"\n\nRahila squints at him. \"A mouse?\"\n\n\"Space-mice.

It holds a mighty tribute.\" The Wizard, Rakthrin, War-Council, whispers Xivu Arath's bait to the Knight. \n\nKelgorath remembers how Savath\u00fbn sought the Sky and became its puppet, all so she could usurp sword logic. \"Favor wanes. It can be rekindled.\" \n\n\"You were disarmed. Shamed. Beaten so many times by a Light-wielder.\" \n\nKelgorath stands, spinning to face Rakthrin. He thrusts a claw forward at the Wizard's throat, but she swoops back from his reach.  \n\nKelgorath sneers. \"I need no blade; I am wielded. The plates upon my body are razors.\" \n\n\"Should you have remained with Savath\u00fbn and prayed to her to give you the Light\u2026 perhaps you would have found greatness then. You wither without her favor.\" \n\n\"I spit on the Witch Sister! I am an instrument of War!\" \n\n\"Not yet. Not truly.\" \n\nRakthrin conjures a dark bolt of lightning that saps the room's dim lighting and casts it into the altar. The altar splits apart with a timbered snap, revealing an emerald sliver of a blade, bleeding shade and whispering rapture. \"A shard of the Taken King's blade. Conquered out of love. Stolen away from Saturn's shadow.\" \n\nKelgorath fixates upon the blade shard. The Wizard gestures to it with a lipless smile, and the Knight steps forward.\n\n\"I will take it. To be an instrument of her will. To cleanse the hate of weakness with loving violence.\" Kelgorath genuflects and encloses his claws around the emerald sliver, wisps of shadow spilling between the gaps in his claws. \"I offer myself to this union.\" \n\nThe barrier of his flesh melts away. A will not his own enraptures him.  \n\nKelgorath, Risen from Bones, Taken by War.",

I have completed my sweep through the Reef and am filing an incident report hence forth referred to as Inc-01, should it be referenced.\n\nShuffling is heard as the speaker adjusts. Papers sift and the microphone crackles slightly. \n\nRc-9: The basis of my visit to the Tangled Shore was to conduct routine Vanguard/Reef security sweeps, as agreed upon since the day of incursion. I was escorted most of the way to the Shore by Awoken gunships, and only landed once my long-range scanner picked up a sub-audio reading emanating from the underbelly of one of the larger asteroid landmasses. \n\nThe speaker clears their throat. \n\nRc-9: I called in the disturbance to a nearby Awoken vessel and was told to, and I quote, \"Mind my own business and be on my way,\" so naturally, I thanked them for their assistance, feigned departure, and landed to check it out. They didn't seem to notice the signal. At the signal's source, I discovered a small camp of what I initially thought were Scorn. Upon further observation, I found that these were not Scorn but Fallen afflicted with some kind of flesh deformity and mental degradation. Shot one dead and the others just looked at me. They didn't fight back. Fired a few cesium charges into the asteroid hole and watched 'em burn. Just sat there. I didn't hear it clearly, but they were chanting something. I don't know. Hard to hear over the fire. \n\nThe speaker laughs to themselves and emulates popping noises. \n\nRc-9: I heard more of them whispering a little deeper in, so I waited for the area to burn out and continued inside. I found one structure of apparent Hive architecture, though it did not appear to have been constructed in any traditional sense\u2026 but then again, I don't know what I should even expect from the Hive at this point. A single Fallen was inside, became violent when I approached and brandished a weapon. The weapon was not loaded, and I put them down. \n\nRc-9: My logs will show a few recovered pieces of equipment that I will list now. One presumably organic section of the Hive structure. It is perpetually wet, just\u2026 great job on that, and causes dizziness and blurred vision when held with ungloved hands. It also has the unnerving ability to project dysphoria or general unease. I was asked to collect a sample for study by my CO. I've done that. Put it in a lead box all the way in the back of the cargo hold. Yeah. Eternal tithings to Xivu Arath. Whatever. Um\u2026 as I was saying. \n\nA tin is heard being unlatched. \n\nRc-9: Also recovered: one tube-style Grenade Launcher. It has no foundry markings. Definitely not Fallen, and I don't think the Scorn even know how to make weapons. Do the Awoken make Grenade Launchers? Always struck me as a Human weapon. Beautiful weapon. The thing wants to be used. Maybe I'll get an opportunity to use it before I get back to the Tower. Lastly, I recovered a locational tracker from one of the Fallen. Following it back to someplace else in the Reef. Little remote. I'll call in my findings once I've finished there. \n\nRc-9: Beautiful weapon. \n\nThe recording cuts.",

Captain Hennek, you still with us?\n\nCC03: Reading you loud and clear, Guardian! What's the plan? Those Cabal cruisers are right behind us!\n\nHG01: I'm sending you new coordinates! We'll make a few short jumps; try to lose them in the Re\u2014\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-236\n\nHG01: \u2014still work. Ah, see! Green blinking light means power.\n\nUNK1: This ship will never fly again, Human. What value is there in a flight recorder?\n\nHG01: You never write a journal before?\n\nUNK1: I have. But I fail to see the value.\n\nHG01: Well my options here are to talk to you\u2014and no offense, but you Reefborn are an acquired taste\u2014or talk to that one, and I don't speak Fallen.\n\nUNK2: [untranslated]\n\nHG01: You see what I mean?\n\nUNK1: So you would rather\u2026 talk to yourself.\n\nHG01: Now you got it. C'mon, help me disconnect the primary power coupli\u2014\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-238\n\nHG01: Been trying to figure out how to word this. Don't know if I'll ever make it back to Earth. The thought of not saying goodbye to you keeps eating away at me.\n\nHG01: I don't know if you're safe. Don't know if you made it out of the City. \n\nHG01: Comms are down, Cabal control the channels. Been trying to get the Awoken to help, but after the whoopin' Oryx gave them, they're reluctant to get between us and the Cabal.\n\nHG01: I miss you so damn much.\n\nHG01: If we see each other again, none of this will matter. I'll complain about Reef cuisine, you'll criticize all my tactical choices, and I'll fall asleep in your arms\u2026 None of this'll matter.\n\nHG01: But in case it does, I just\u2014I want you to know I love you. That, even out here beyond the light, I never forgot you.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-239\n\nHG01: We got the old Dead Orbit ship set up as a shelter. Atmospheric controls are still working, heat, radiation shielding seems good. The friendly Fallen out here are real helpful. I thought they were slaves of the Awoken at first, but it's\u2026 not like that at all.\n\nHG01: Captain Hennek finally succumbed to his injuries. I was with him when he went. Last thing he said to me was, \"I guess, right now, we're not all that different.\"\n\nHG01: [long silence]\n\nHG01: I wish you were here.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-240\n\n[ENTRY DELETED]\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-241\n\n[ENTRY DELETED]\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-242\n\nHG01: A Fallen named Kesk is helping me hardwire a linguistic modulator his people built into the flight recorder. Should translate their speech back to me in something I can understand, and then I can run it through the vocal processing heuristics onboard my jumpship to speak back.\n\nHG01: Faster than learning a language I don't have the mouth parts to speak.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-243\n\nHG01: Today was our anniversary. I hope we were looking at the same stars.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-244\n\nHG01: Traveler.\n\nUNK2: <<Great Machine.>>\n\nHG01: Huh. Okay.\n\nHG01: Family.\n\nUNK2: <<Ketch.>>\n\nHG01: Okay, that's where we're hitting a wall. Can we try some root words? We need to build the Fallen database.\n\nUNK2: <<Eliksni.>>\n\nHG01: Right, sorry. Eliksni.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-245\n\n[ENTRY DELETED]\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-246\n\nHG01: I had this dream\u2026 like a memory of a memory, you know? But I swear, I heard your laugh when I woke up.\n\nHG01: Being Lightless is hard, but it's\u2026 it's these little phantom pains that are the hardest.\n\nHG01: I feel like my whole life is a phantom limb. \n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-247\n\nHG01: Light.\n\nUNK2: Light.\n\nHG01: I'm not sure why I'm surprised by that.\n\nUNK2: <<We are all forged in the Light. It is what we lost.>>\n\nHG01: Yeah.\n\nUNK2: <<We are not all that different now, you and I.>>\n\nHG01: W-why do you say that?\n\nUNK2: <<When we live, it is in the shadow of the life we once had. When we die, it is the end of our story.>>\n\n[Long Silence]\n\nHG01: That\u2026 makes sense.\n\nUNK2: <<Many things do, when you take the time to stop and listen. To hear.>>\n\n[Long Silence]\n\nHG01: Dig.\n\nUNK2: <<Dig.>>\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-248\n\n[ENTRY DELETED]\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-250\n\nHG01: I'm heading back to Earth. The locals agreed to take care of the civilians.\n\nHG01: I don't know if I'll find you, but I can't sit here anymore.\n\nHG01: If I find you, you'll never hear this. But if I don't, and I live\u2026 Being here has opened my eyes to a lot of things and I just\u2014I can't fight like this anymore. Not without you. There's an enclave out past the Jovians; pacifists. You'll find me there.\n\nHG01: Kesk will have my Sidearm. I told him to give it to you if you come looking for me. Or\u2026 if he finds out you're\u2014gone\u2014to send it to the Vanguard.\n\nHG01: I won't need it anymore.\n\nHG01: All I need is you.\n\n// End Logs",

The fact that you think you can interpret what has driven dozens to insanity doesn't give me a good deal of confidence in your decision-making abilities, and I can't keep my concerns internal any longer. We don't need another Sundaresh in the upper ranks.\n\nI don't care if you saw the Red War before it happened. What would you say of the several other unfruitful predictions you conveniently ignore now?\n\nI have listened to your speeches and read your many messages calling for support. I understand you believe the future is at stake, and we are supposed to do something about that. Fear over the Fallen is not the future this organization was meant to combat. Your paranoia won't change my mind.\n\nMy children were harassed in the streets today for daring to bring food to the Eliksni Quarter. They came home in tears, and I wonder how long until it becomes worse. I won't be a part of spreading that fear. I won't participate in splitting this City and turning it against itself. I'm well aware of the dangers posed by Fallen Houses, but the City remains strong because we stand together.\n\nYou're a student of history. You know how the Iron Lords converted Warlords into dutiful servants of the Light. Lord Shaxx alone should speak to the value of that effort. If a Fallen House wants to stand with us against their own\u2014just like the Warlords of old, just like Fallen in the Reef did\u2014who are you to tell them no?\n\nArmies, we can keep out. The Guardians will hold the wall. That danger is nowhere close to the death from within that you are stoking. If it all falls apart, just remember Mithrax didn't fire the first shot. You did.\n\nConsider this my resignation,\n\nNovarro",
