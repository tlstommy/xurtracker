The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

Between the Vanguard's support, generous contributions from the Awoken, and several upgrades courtesy of a lapsed Dead Orbit adherent, the ship's a lot to be entrusted with. \n\n\"These new sensors are something else,\" Isidro announces from the cockpit. \"If so much as a mouse sneezes out there in the black, we'll pick it up.\"\n\nRahila squints at him. \"A mouse?\"\n\n\"Space-mice.

Or mysterious, freaky signals.\" \n\n\"Vanguard will be along in a few to see us off.\" Roche-5's composed baritone emerges from the hatch leading to the cargo hold. \"You two ready?\" \n\n Rahila settles into the copilot's chair. \"To go find out what's left of our solar system? 'Course we are.\" \n\n\"Remember,\" Roche intones gravely, \"This is pure recon. No big risks.\" \n\nRahila and Isidro exchange grins. \"Sure thing.\"",

I never felt like he gave me an honest chance.\" Petra paused to consider. \"Maybe he'd already looked in the future and saw that I'd washed out.\" \n\n\"I didn't know exactly how unsuited I was until my sister started her training,\" Petra continued. \"Right away, Pinar and I began having long conversations inside our dreams. We'd talk all night and wake up with full memories of what we'd said. That was the first time I realized how powerful she'd become.\" \n\nPetra lowered her eyes. \"Of course, Pinar was Imar's favorite. And the more quickly she progressed, the stronger our shared dreams became. It didn't take long before it was more than just talking.\" \n\n\"She began to manipulate the dreams\u2014changing locations or her shape. I couldn't keep up. It was like being a passenger in my own head. Her dreams became my nightmares.\" Petra shook her head, as if dislodging an unwelcome memory. \"That's when I quit the training and the dreams stopped.\" \n\n\"Eventually I found my place in the Corsairs,\" Petra mused, \"but part of me wishes I had finished my training as a Techeun. If I had, maybe I could still find Pinar out there, in a dream somewhere.\" She plucked a blade of grass from between the paving stones and tossed it into the breeze. \n\nAfter a pensive moment, Petra focused again on Ylaia. \"So, my suggestion is to give the training a chance. If it takes, you'll know. And if not,\" she patted the grenade launcher at her side, \"we've got plenty of other jobs for you.\"",

A cautionary tale. \n\nA Wizard floats over the altar. \"The High Celebrant's domain was once a grand place of adoration. It holds a mighty tribute.\" The Wizard, Rakthrin, War-Council, whispers Xivu Arath's bait to the Knight. \n\nKelgorath remembers how Savath\u00fbn sought the Sky and became its puppet, all so she could usurp sword logic. \"Favor wanes. It can be rekindled.\" \n\n\"You were disarmed. Shamed. Beaten so many times by a Light-wielder.\" \n\nKelgorath stands, spinning to face Rakthrin. He thrusts a claw forward at the Wizard's throat, but she swoops back from his reach.  \n\nKelgorath sneers. \"I need no blade; I am wielded. The plates upon my body are razors.\" \n\n\"Should you have remained with Savath\u00fbn and prayed to her to give you the Light\u2026 perhaps you would have found greatness then. You wither without her favor.\" \n\n\"I spit on the Witch Sister! I am an instrument of War!\" \n\n\"Not yet. Not truly.\" \n\nRakthrin conjures a dark bolt of lightning that saps the room's dim lighting and casts it into the altar. The altar splits apart with a timbered snap, revealing an emerald sliver of a blade, bleeding shade and whispering rapture. \"A shard of the Taken King's blade. Conquered out of love. Stolen away from Saturn's shadow.\" \n\nKelgorath fixates upon the blade shard. The Wizard gestures to it with a lipless smile, and the Knight steps forward.\n\n\"I will take it. To be an instrument of her will. To cleanse the hate of weakness with loving violence.\" Kelgorath genuflects and encloses his claws around the emerald sliver, wisps of shadow spilling between the gaps in his claws. \"I offer myself to this union.\" \n\nThe barrier of his flesh melts away. A will not his own enraptures him.  \n\nKelgorath, Risen from Bones, Taken by War.",

We may not have all the answers, but here's what we know:\n\nRemote scans of the \"Endless Night\" either failed to return data or returned contradictory data; this behavior suggested an emittance of electromagnetic disruption, which indicated that this is more than a simulation projected over the City. Confirmation of this disruption has occurred as every probe sent into the clouds, even shielded ones, experienced acute electrical overload within seconds.\n\nNow having confirmed the existence of the EM field, we have reached a new hypothesis in our reevaluation of our initial scans. We believe that we are not, in fact, receiving contradictory data\u2026 but a scrambling of our own scans, rewritten with new information.\n\nThese scans are subsequently being bounced back to us and are infiltrating our systems via rooting programs masquerading as collected data. Anyone wondering how they've managed to shut down our power distribution and water purification facilities without firing a shot needs look no further. They set a trap, and we sprang it. This information absolutely must be aired to the rest of the Consensus.\n\nSome of my colleagues believe the actual \"night\" visualization is meant to be a means of psychological warfare. Whether that is intended or not is unclear, though there has undoubtedly been an effect on the population, as reports of illness and sleep loss have spiked considerably.\n\nI've moved to cease all data collection, but I have repeatedly been overridden by higher clearances. I must, again, recommend that we sever all connections and terminate any data collection sweeps. We're digging our own graves, otherwise.\n\nWhatever executive still has that uplink running, knock it off. You're playing with fire here.\n\n\u2014FWC R&D Head, Arsha Saad",

I am always impressed with the resilience of the Guardians, with or without their Light. Saint tells me the Titan Sloane embraced the Taken, and she is doing well.\"\n\n\"Yes, and for that, I am grateful,\" Ikora said. \"But\u2026 they don't always come back, Mithrax. An old friend of mine was corrupted by the Vex in a similar way. He stayed behind when the Pyramids attacked, just like Sloane. But I believe we lost him.\"\n\n\"I am sorry about your friend,\" Mithrax said somberly. \"I hope he is remembered as a hero.\"\n\nIkora raised her eyebrows but said nothing.\n\n\"I, too, encountered a great mind consumed by the Vex,\" Mithrax continued. \"The Guardian and I attempted a rescue, but it went deeper into the network as it gained the access it sought. It taught me that the pursuit of truth is worth any price\u2014even one's own sense of self.\"\n\nIkora smiled. \"Asher would have agreed with every word of that.\"\n\nMithrax leaned forward in amazement, a leech dangling limply from his claws. \"You knew Ashermere?\"\n\nIkora cocked her head. \"Yes, Asher Mir. How on earth did you know him?\"\n\n\"Asher\u2026 Mir,\" Mithrax said slowly to himself, mimicking Ikora. \"That is why I have been unable to locate any records.\"\n\n\"Ikora,\" he said, straightening himself in his seat, \"I must tell you a story about our friend, Asher Mir, the hero.\"",

Instead, the Guardian surged through the air, dodging explosion after explosion. Their Light seared through the Scorn, burning them alive.  \n\nIt wasn't long before the smoke cleared and the Guardian stood alone, their Light thrumming with tithes. Immaru grumbled to himself.  \n\nFor as long as he'd been a Ghost, he'd resented how the Guardians referred to the Light. It was never \"my Ghost's Light\" or \"the Traveler's Light.\" No\u2014it was always \"MY Light.\" They talked about it like they owned it. Like they were entitled to it. Like they earned it. \n\nBut looking down at the smoldering battlefield, Immaru had to admit that the Guardians' arrogance served them well. It gave them the confidence to mold their Light in the fashion that suited them best. They treated it like a tool\u2014something to be used. That gave them an advantage over the Lucent Brood, whose manipulation of the Light was inhibited by reverence. \n\nImmaru turned away from the ritual circle in disgust.

The feed he was about to watch could easily be misconstrued.  \n\nAs it was, the City smoldered with rumors from citizens and Guardians alike. The persistent, undulating hole in the Traveler's side put everyone on edge. Hearing that Vanguard leadership was using Hive magic to fulfil a bargain put forth by the Witch Queen would undoubtedly stoke the flames of panic. \n\nZavala leaned grimly over his desk to watch the Guardian's latest tithes to Eris Morn.  \n\nIt used to be simple, he lamented. We exterminated the Hive wherever we found them, and we felt good about it. Justified. But in recent years, morally ambiguous situations like these had become more common, and separating friend from foe was increasingly difficult. \n\nOver the feed, Eris Morn's face lit up with fierce elation as the Guardian's tithes flowed through her. Her Hive form seemed to swell with power. Zavala knew that Eris undertook the rituals with temperance, at least for now, but he wondered how long her clarity would last. Elsie Bray's warnings had been too vivid to dismiss entirely, even after Ikora's reassurances. \n\nZavala turned away from the feed to gaze out the window at the Traveler. The trauma puncturing its side reminded him of the stakes. The reasons they were taking such risks. \n\nHe sighed, wondering how many more compromises they would have to make before the end.",

They were perhaps the most delicious thing Ikora had tasted in the last 20 years. And while the two of them worked their way through the jar, Mithrax uncomfortably stumbled his way to his question.\n\n\"Eris Morn has changed,\" he said carefully, and Ikora nodded. \"She chose to change, and she acted out of\u2026 is there a Human word for 'love-bravery'?\"\n\nIkora smiled. \"Love,\" she said.\n\n\"Love, then,\" Mithrax nodded. \"If she were to change forever, if she cannot return to herself, will she be remembered well? Since her first choice was made from love?\"\n\nIkora responded as though she had not struggled with the thought a thousand times already. \"Eris will always be Eris, no matter what form she takes,\" she said.\n\nMithrax harrumphed in satisfaction and leaned forward to take another leech. \"Yes. I am always impressed with the resilience of the Guardians, with or without their Light. Saint tells me the Titan Sloane embraced the Taken, and she is doing well.\"\n\n\"Yes, and for that, I am grateful,\" Ikora said. \"But\u2026 they don't always come back, Mithrax. An old friend of mine was corrupted by the Vex in a similar way. He stayed behind when the Pyramids attacked, just like Sloane. But I believe we lost him.\"\n\n\"I am sorry about your friend,\" Mithrax said somberly. \"I hope he is remembered as a hero.\"\n\nIkora raised her eyebrows but said nothing.\n\n\"I, too, encountered a great mind consumed by the Vex,\" Mithrax continued. \"The Guardian and I attempted a rescue, but it went deeper into the network as it gained the access it sought. It taught me that the pursuit of truth is worth any price\u2014even one's own sense of self.\"\n\nIkora smiled. \"Asher would have agreed with every word of that.\"\n\nMithrax leaned forward in amazement, a leech dangling limply from his claws. \"You knew Ashermere?\"\n\nIkora cocked her head. \"Yes, Asher Mir. How on earth did you know him?\"\n\n\"Asher\u2026 Mir,\" Mithrax said slowly to himself, mimicking Ikora. \"That is why I have been unable to locate any records.\"\n\n\"Ikora,\" he said, straightening himself in his seat, \"I must tell you a story about our friend, Asher Mir, the hero.\"",

Instead, the Guardian surged through the air, dodging explosion after explosion. Their Light seared through the Scorn, burning them alive.  \n\nIt wasn't long before the smoke cleared and the Guardian stood alone, their Light thrumming with tithes. Immaru grumbled to himself.  \n\nFor as long as he'd been a Ghost, he'd resented how the Guardians referred to the Light. It was never \"my Ghost's Light\" or \"the Traveler's Light.\" No\u2014it was always \"MY Light.\" They talked about it like they owned it. Like they were entitled to it. Like they earned it. \n\nBut looking down at the smoldering battlefield, Immaru had to admit that the Guardians' arrogance served them well. It gave them the confidence to mold their Light in the fashion that suited them best. They treated it like a tool\u2014something to be used. That gave them an advantage over the Lucent Brood, whose manipulation of the Light was inhibited by reverence. \n\nImmaru turned away from the ritual circle in disgust. He hated to admit it, but the Lucent Brood had a lot to learn about the Light from the Guardians.  \n\nAnd once they did, the Humans would pay for their lack of respect.",

The feed he was about to watch could easily be misconstrued.  \n\nAs it was, the City smoldered with rumors from citizens and Guardians alike. The persistent, undulating hole in the Traveler's side put everyone on edge. Hearing that Vanguard leadership was using Hive magic to fulfil a bargain put forth by the Witch Queen would undoubtedly stoke the flames of panic. \n\nZavala leaned grimly over his desk to watch the Guardian's latest tithes to Eris Morn.  \n\nIt used to be simple, he lamented. We exterminated the Hive wherever we found them, and we felt good about it. Justified. But in recent years, morally ambiguous situations like these had become more common, and separating friend from foe was increasingly difficult. \n\nOver the feed, Eris Morn's face lit up with fierce elation as the Guardian's tithes flowed through her. Her Hive form seemed to swell with power. Zavala knew that Eris undertook the rituals with temperance, at least for now, but he wondered how long her clarity would last. Elsie Bray's warnings had been too vivid to dismiss entirely, even after Ikora's reassurances. \n\nZavala turned away from the feed to gaze out the window at the Traveler. The trauma puncturing its side reminded him of the stakes. The reasons they were taking such risks. \n\nHe sighed, wondering how many more compromises they would have to make before the end.",

They were perhaps the most delicious thing Ikora had tasted in the last 20 years. And while the two of them worked their way through the jar, Mithrax uncomfortably stumbled his way to his question.\n\n\"Eris Morn has changed,\" he said carefully, and Ikora nodded. \"She chose to change, and she acted out of\u2026 is there a Human word for 'love-bravery'?\"\n\nIkora smiled. \"Love,\" she said.\n\n\"Love, then,\" Mithrax nodded. \"If she were to change forever, if she cannot return to herself, will she be remembered well? Since her first choice was made from love?\"\n\nIkora responded as though she had not struggled with the thought a thousand times already. \"Eris will always be Eris, no matter what form she takes,\" she said.\n\nMithrax harrumphed in satisfaction and leaned forward to take another leech. \"Yes. I am always impressed with the resilience of the Guardians, with or without their Light. Saint tells me the Titan Sloane embraced the Taken, and she is doing well.\"\n\n\"Yes, and for that, I am grateful,\" Ikora said. \"But\u2026 they don't always come back, Mithrax. An old friend of mine was corrupted by the Vex in a similar way. He stayed behind when the Pyramids attacked, just like Sloane. But I believe we lost him.\"\n\n\"I am sorry about your friend,\" Mithrax said somberly. \"I hope he is remembered as a hero.\"\n\nIkora raised her eyebrows but said nothing.\n\n\"I, too, encountered a great mind consumed by the Vex,\" Mithrax continued. \"The Guardian and I attempted a rescue, but it went deeper into the network as it gained the access it sought. It taught me that the pursuit of truth is worth any price\u2014even one's own sense of self.\"\n\nIkora smiled. \"Asher would have agreed with every word of that.\"\n\nMithrax leaned forward in amazement, a leech dangling limply from his claws. \"You knew Ashermere?\"\n\nIkora cocked her head. \"Yes, Asher Mir. How on earth did you know him?\"\n\n\"Asher\u2026 Mir,\" Mithrax said slowly to himself, mimicking Ikora. \"That is why I have been unable to locate any records.\"\n\n\"Ikora,\" he said, straightening himself in his seat, \"I must tell you a story about our friend, Asher Mir, the hero.\"",

They were about to initiate a new ritual, and the Hive Ghost was keen to see their response. \n\nWhen the Screebs started pouring in, Immaru couldn't help himself. \"Oops! This one's all Screebs,\" he chortled. \"Have fun.\" \n\nHe expected the ritual to end promptly in a shower of Dark Ether. Instead, the Guardian surged through the air, dodging explosion after explosion. Their Light seared through the Scorn, burning them alive.  \n\nIt wasn't long before the smoke cleared and the Guardian stood alone, their Light thrumming with tithes. Immaru grumbled to himself.  \n\nFor as long as he'd been a Ghost, he'd resented how the Guardians referred to the Light. It was never \"my Ghost's Light\" or \"the Traveler's Light.\" No\u2014it was always \"MY Light.\" They talked about it like they owned it. Like they were entitled to it. Like they earned it. \n\nBut looking down at the smoldering battlefield, Immaru had to admit that the Guardians' arrogance served them well. It gave them the confidence to mold their Light in the fashion that suited them best. They treated it like a tool\u2014something to be used. That gave them an advantage over the Lucent Brood, whose manipulation of the Light was inhibited by reverence. \n\nImmaru turned away from the ritual circle in disgust. He hated to admit it, but the Lucent Brood had a lot to learn about the Light from the Guardians.  \n\nAnd once they did, the Humans would pay for their lack of respect.",

The feed he was about to watch could easily be misconstrued.  \n\nAs it was, the City smoldered with rumors from citizens and Guardians alike. The persistent, undulating hole in the Traveler's side put everyone on edge. Hearing that Vanguard leadership was using Hive magic to fulfil a bargain put forth by the Witch Queen would undoubtedly stoke the flames of panic. \n\nZavala leaned grimly over his desk to watch the Guardian's latest tithes to Eris Morn.  \n\nIt used to be simple, he lamented. We exterminated the Hive wherever we found them, and we felt good about it. Justified. But in recent years, morally ambiguous situations like these had become more common, and separating friend from foe was increasingly difficult. \n\nOver the feed, Eris Morn's face lit up with fierce elation as the Guardian's tithes flowed through her. Her Hive form seemed to swell with power. Zavala knew that Eris undertook the rituals with temperance, at least for now, but he wondered how long her clarity would last. Elsie Bray's warnings had been too vivid to dismiss entirely, even after Ikora's reassurances. \n\nZavala turned away from the feed to gaze out the window at the Traveler. The trauma puncturing its side reminded him of the stakes. The reasons they were taking such risks. \n\nHe sighed, wondering how many more compromises they would have to make before the end.",
