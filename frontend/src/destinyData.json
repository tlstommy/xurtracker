The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

It is how we describe the portions of the universe that we can observe. While numbers can track the abstract and find pattern in chaos, they cannot account for fundamental aspects of reality such as compassion or justice. The existence of the Lucent Hive, and Hive Ghosts in particular, may expand our understanding of causality, but they themselves are not \"new\"\u2014the only thing that is new is our awareness and observation of them. These Ghosts have already been living alongside us. They've traveled with us. Endured with us.\n\nWhat we see is the mushroom, the fruit of the fungus. The fungus itself is a vast mycorrhizal network of filaments growing and working unseen below the soil, often barely connected to the fruiting bodies we observe. Similarly, we have observed Ghosts\u2014Hive Ghosts included\u2014without understanding the nature of the unseen filaments that may guide us. \n\nIn our eagerness to understand the universe, we must not assume our observations are complete, or objective. Otherwise, we blind ourselves to possibilities\u2026 like the possibility that an unnoticed faction among us may be one temptation away from betrayal. Or that what drives our creator is no more than the same base desire for survival that drives all living things.\n\n\u2014On Secants, Introduction, Ophiuchus",

Nothing cowardly about it, just couldn't risk the noise of a firefight and didn't want 'em to know how close they were. Forced to shadow one of the big Chieftains for a while. Couldn't stand being close to it like that, even in the mountain air.\n\nFinally found the frigate. Thing had spread itself across a gully, out of eyesight from most recon teams. Of course, my eyes are better than most.\n\nFigured the cargo should have survived a low-atmo crash like that intact. Found two big crates of Cabal gold. Some statues, plates, gongs, that kind of thing. Transmatted the valuables out of there and left the rest for the rain.\n\nStarted feeling pretty good when something startled the hell out of me: a voice. Weak and quiet\u2014the kind of quiet you get toward the very end.\n\nCracked into the wreckage and found a big Cabal warrior pinned in a hallway. Dropped it with no issue. Found a Lightbearer prisoner stuck the next room over\u2014banged up, dehydrated, but alive.\n\nLightbearer seemed traumatized, but it was nothing personal. Gun butt to the temple quieted him right down. Tossed him on the back of my Sparrow and dropped him off at a recon station before he woke up. Outpost wasn't expecting survivors, so they needed their arms twisted before they'd pay up.\n\nIt's a thankless job, but that's all right. Thanks don't pay my debts.",

Look, I have a damaged jumpship, and I'm escorting a frigate of civilians! Clear me for landing!\n\nVSYS: Clearance denied. Venus Forward Operating Base automated orbital defenses now online. \n\nHG01: No! Turn 'em off!\n\nVSYS: I cannot comply.\n\nHG01: Worthless piece of scrap!\n\nHG01: New plan! Captain Hennek, you still with us?\n\nCC03: Reading you loud and clear, Guardian! What's the plan? Those Cabal cruisers are right behind us!\n\nHG01: I'm sending you new coordinates! We'll make a few short jumps; try to lose them in the Re\u2014\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-236\n\nHG01: \u2014still work. Ah, see! Green blinking light means power.\n\nUNK1: This ship will never fly again, Human. What value is there in a flight recorder?\n\nHG01: You never write a journal before?\n\nUNK1: I have. But I fail to see the value.\n\nHG01: Well my options here are to talk to you\u2014and no offense, but you Reefborn are an acquired taste\u2014or talk to that one, and I don't speak Fallen.\n\nUNK2: [untranslated]\n\nHG01: You see what I mean?\n\nUNK1: So you would rather\u2026 talk to yourself.\n\nHG01: Now you got it. C'mon, help me disconnect the primary power coupli\u2014\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-238\n\nHG01: Been trying to figure out how to word this. Don't know if I'll ever make it back to Earth. The thought of not saying goodbye to you keeps eating away at me.\n\nHG01: I don't know if you're safe. Don't know if you made it out of the City. \n\nHG01: Comms are down, Cabal control the channels. Been trying to get the Awoken to help, but after the whoopin' Oryx gave them, they're reluctant to get between us and the Cabal.\n\nHG01: I miss you so damn much.\n\nHG01: If we see each other again, none of this will matter. I'll complain about Reef cuisine, you'll criticize all my tactical choices, and I'll fall asleep in your arms\u2026 None of this'll matter.\n\nHG01: But in case it does, I just\u2014I want you to know I love you. That, even out here beyond the light, I never forgot you.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-239\n\nHG01: We got the old Dead Orbit ship set up as a shelter. Atmospheric controls are still working, heat, radiation shielding seems good. The friendly Fallen out here are real helpful. I thought they were slaves of the Awoken at first, but it's\u2026 not like that at all.\n\nHG01: Captain Hennek finally succumbed to his injuries. I was with him when he went.

Should translate their speech back to me in something I can understand, and then I can run it through the vocal processing heuristics onboard my jumpship to speak back.\n\nHG01: Faster than learning a language I don't have the mouth parts to speak.\n\nFLIGHT_RECORDER_LOG // VG777-T // L-243\n\nHG01: Today was our anniversary.

But if I don't, and I live\u2026 Being here has opened my eyes to a lot of things and I just\u2014I can't fight like this anymore. Not without you. There's an enclave out past the Jovians; pacifists. You'll find me there.\n\nHG01: Kesk will have my Sidearm. I told him to give it to you if you come looking for me. Or\u2026 if he finds out you're\u2014gone\u2014to send it to the Vanguard.\n\nHG01: I won't need it anymore.\n\nHG01: All I need is you.\n\n// End Logs",

Crimiq-5 watched tense bursts of movement and exchanges of fire as his team jockeyed for position.\n\nSola had ripped through their previous opponents with off-putting ferocity, and Crimiq was ready for this to be their last match of the day. He looked over her through his scope. Sola's silhouette marinated in an eerie shimmer that distorted the air as she moved. He stilled his body and sent a shot over her head to force an opponent back into cover.\n\n\"Aiming a little close.\" Sola sent a glare over her shoulder into the sun.\n\nCrimiq-5 moved his scope off her. \"Duck.\"\n\nHis earpiece crackled.

Crimiq saw a bright flash burst from the hallway leading toward C-point.\n\n\"Be advised, I'm leaving the perch. Moving to trade for Katake.\"\n\nHe slid into position and snapped his trusted long rifle down lane. His sights found an unlucky Titan, lightning still crackling from their armor.\n\n\"Fate Cries Foul for you, brother.\" The shot hit squarely, and the Titan dropped. \"Sorry I couldn't save you Katake.

A Ghost reduced to little more than a bare sphere of metal, deprived of a shell, hovers in the corner of the cockpit, watching the Warsat track its path across lonely Venus.\n\n\"There are no sanctioned Vanguard operations on Venus at present,\" the Ghost clarifies, pivoting its cold blue eye up to its Guardian. \"Why do you think he's down there?\"\n\nThe Warlock Shayura reclines against her seat, the old leather creaking. Her attention is not on her Ghost, but rather the Human skull sitting in the middle of her command console. Its hollow eye sockets stare back at her.\n\n\"It hardly matters why he's there,\" Shayura indicates listlessly as she examines the skull's cheekbones. Her fingers graze the microfractures\u2014an artifact of Shotgun pellet impact. \"All that matters is we find him.\"\n\nShayura's Ghost looks away from her and focuses on Venus's soft glow in the dark.\n\n\"When will you be returning to Earth?\" he asks.\n\nShayura doesn't vocalize a response, but instead blinks and reorients her glowing-eyed stare on the Ghost. It beeps softly, reconsidering the question.\n\n\"Will you?\" the Ghost still wonders.\n\n\"No,\" Shayura answers flatly. \"There is nothing to go back to. Everyone has either abandoned me or betrayed me. All I have left is the Traveler. And I do not need to be in the City to feel the Light.\" As she says that, Shayura lifts her hand and calls up a rolling curtain of flame from her palm.\n\n\"Praxic Fire guides me,\" Shayura says with the blaze reflecting in her eyes.\n\n//NS66CE_LOG-D// VENUS-IS -IA //\n\n\"You see? Still protected. Valuable.\"\n\nHurrying up a shallow set of rubble-strewn steps, a short Eliksni bearing the crest of the House of Light pauses, gazing back at the chrome-armored Guardian moving up the steps behind him. The Eliksni looks the Guardian up and down, then motions to the stark silhouette of a gray concrete-block building rising up from the Venusian overgrowth.\n\n\"This ain't the academy proper,\" the Guardian says on ascent, watching the hazy sky for signs of danger. Moisture clings in glistening beads to his reflective mask; his dark hood shields him from the rest of the elements. \"The hell was this place?\"\n\nThe Eliksni tilts his head to the side, four eyes blinking independently from one another. \"Not Human, don't know. But machine inside.\"\n\n\"Why aren't your people bringing it back? Don't you folks get promotions for finding good salvage or something?\" the Guardian asks, gesturing to the crumbling building.\n\nThe Eliksni once again tilts his head, expression opaque. \"You listen to the Spider's sneak-words too eagerly. Come, we have a long walk to\u2014\" The Eliksni's words are cut off, garbled in a wet scream as he is perforated by a barrage of Submachine Gun fire.\n\nThe Guardian turns, cloak swirling behind him and Hand Cannon at the ready. But it isn't Vex or Fallen descending from the high cliffs\u2014it's a Guardian in black and gold armor gliding to the ground, smoke issuing from the muzzle of her SMG. Shayura's boots lightly touch the leaf-strewn plaza, her eyeless mask fixed on the chrome-clad Hunter.\n\n\"He wasn't a combatant!\" the Hunter shouts.\n\nShayura slowly approaches the Guardian. \"Did you find him within the hem of Eramis's skirt? Or did you swear yourself to the Darkness after her passing?\"\n\nThe Hunter backs away, up the stairs, Hand Cannon trained on Shayura. He recognizes her armor for what it is\u2014a reward of the Trials. \"I know you\u2026\" His voice quavers. \"You shouldn't be here. When did the Vanguard let you out?\"\n\n\"They didn't. I let myself out since they were too busy opening the gates for our enemies,\" Shayura indicates, motioning with the barrel of her SMG to the dead Eliksni. \"But, you know why I'm here .\"\n\n\"I know you're a few rounds short of a full clip,\" the Guardian quips back, making a flippant gesture with his Hand Cannon. In that moment of distraction, Shayura shoots him six times in two short bursts.\n\nThe Guardian collapses, his gun tumbling down the steps. A moment later, his Ghost materializes, shell flared in anger. \"What are you doing?! We\u2014\" \n\nShayura moves like a lightning bolt, materializing beside the Ghost with an upward flourish of a sword of raw Praxic Fire. The Ghost looses a howling scream of horror as he shatters into a flurry of glittering pieces.\n\nCrumpled on the stairs, the Hunter coughs, his throat damp with blood. Shayura pulls her attention away from the shattered Ghost, training her SMG down at her quarry. \"Traitor,\" she says in a shaky, gasping breath fueled by adrenaline.\n\nThe Hunter laughs, gagging on his own blood as he does. \"You're no better than the Dredgen ,\" he says, in pain. Then, even quieter, \"\u2026or Malphur .\"\n\n\"I killed an agent of the Darkness,\" Shayura says, and the Hunter has no rebuttal this time. He is still.\n\nBile rises in the back of Shayura's throat.\n\n\"They come in many forms.\"",

The shadows around her are equally starved. She knows, because she's starved too. \n\nUnlike them, she controls it. For every shadow around her, beckoning her to join them, her muzzle cracks. She slips, she ducks, and everywhere she sees an opening, her will hardens. She throws her bones, wrapped in unrelenting plasteel, into the fray.
