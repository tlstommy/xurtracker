The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

Walking up the gangway into the ship itself makes her want to cry.\n\nThe ship has the necessary long-range capabilities and just enough expanded capacity for a full fireteam's worth of supplies and survey equipment. Between the Vanguard's support, generous contributions from the Awoken, and several upgrades courtesy of a lapsed Dead Orbit adherent, the ship's a lot to be entrusted with. \n\n\"These new sensors are something else,\" Isidro announces from the cockpit. \"If so much as a mouse sneezes out there in the black, we'll pick it up.\"\n\nRahila squints at him. \"A mouse?\"\n\n\"Space-mice. Or, you know, a gravitational anomaly. Or mysterious, freaky signals.\" \n\n\"Vanguard will be along in a few to see us off.\" Roche-5's composed baritone emerges from the hatch leading to the cargo hold. \"You two ready?\" \n\n Rahila settles into the copilot's chair. \"To go find out what's left of our solar system? 'Course we are.\" \n\n\"Remember,\" Roche intones gravely, \"This is pure recon. No big risks.\" \n\nRahila and Isidro exchange grins. \"Sure thing.\"",

He was one of the oldest, and the only male Techeun I ever met. I never felt like he gave me an honest chance.\" Petra paused to consider. \"Maybe he'd already looked in the future and saw that I'd washed out.\" \n\n\"I didn't know exactly how unsuited I was until my sister started her training,\" Petra continued. \"Right away, Pinar and I began having long conversations inside our dreams. We'd talk all night and wake up with full memories of what we'd said. That was the first time I realized how powerful she'd become.\" \n\nPetra lowered her eyes. \"Of course, Pinar was Imar's favorite. And the more quickly she progressed, the stronger our shared dreams became. It didn't take long before it was more than just talking.\" \n\n\"She began to manipulate the dreams\u2014changing locations or her shape. I couldn't keep up. It was like being a passenger in my own head. Her dreams became my nightmares.\" Petra shook her head, as if dislodging an unwelcome memory. \"That's when I quit the training and the dreams stopped.\" \n\n\"Eventually I found my place in the Corsairs,\" Petra mused, \"but part of me wishes I had finished my training as a Techeun. If I had, maybe I could still find Pinar out there, in a dream somewhere.\" She plucked a blade of grass from between the paving stones and tossed it into the breeze. \n\nAfter a pensive moment, Petra focused again on Ylaia. \"So, my suggestion is to give the training a chance. If it takes, you'll know. And if not,\" she patted the grenade launcher at her side, \"we've got plenty of other jobs for you.\"",

They bore the burning sigils of War, dripping soulfire from their branded hulls as if it gushed from an open wound.  \n\nBeneath the churning sea, a Guardian Light wrapped in metal, yet to be coiled in promise, watched the skies turn to ink, and Hive fiends disembark the invading craft. \n\nProclamations scattered across the methane ocean, eager words searing each wave's crest with jade flame. The Hive's intent was clear: tear asunder the claims of the Witch Sister. Raise the banners of War. \n\nLed by a massive Knight, Acolytes descended to depths once infested by denizens of the lie, down to where the song of trickery echoed from long-dead shrieks. They marched in adorant procession, surrounded by a host of Thralls that defaced the remnant traces of Savath\u00fbn's holdings with hungering delight. \n\nHeld aloft in the claws of a central Acolyte was a Wizard's skull, recovered from the flame-licked wash before Titan's capture. The Acolyte delicately placed the skull upon a ragged sheet of conquered foe-flesh while others carved a circle of runes around it. \n\nThe Acolytes took position over the runes. They threw their heads back and howled a discordant melody that ignited the rune-circle, consuming each of them in soulfire conflagration. \n\nThe melody took hold, flooding the flesh of the accompanying Thralls with frenzy. They surged forward, kicked and clawed their kin in a mad scramble to reach the skull first. To claim it. \n\nEach time the melody thrummed, an Acolyte turned to ash. Each time the melody thrummed, spilled Thrall viscera twisted into fetid swirls around the skull. \n\nBlood and ash was offered until none remained; the Knight stepped forward, brandishing a blade of deathly menace. \n\n\"I call Xivu Arath. I invoke War's presence. Take this dreg, cast out by your sister. Take her claims as your own.\" \n\nThe churning soulflame was drawn into the Knight's deathly blade, then plunged into the Wizard's skull. The runic circle projected an ancient realm, and the Knight felt watchful eyes leering from atop a distant Black Terrace perched above that projected realm. The thunderous response pressed him to his knees. \n\nKELGORATH, I ACCEPT THINE OFFERINGS \n\nTHROUGH WILL, LIES ARE UNEARTHED \n\nTHROUGH WILL, LIES ARE MADE TRUTH \n\nTHROUGH WILL, LIES FALL TO CONQUEST \n\n KUDAZAD, BOUND, YOU ARE NAMED IN SERVICE",

A cautionary tale. \n\nA Wizard floats over the altar. \"The High Celebrant's domain was once a grand place of adoration. It holds a mighty tribute.\" The Wizard, Rakthrin, War-Council, whispers Xivu Arath's bait to the Knight. \n\nKelgorath remembers how Savath\u00fbn sought the Sky and became its puppet, all so she could usurp sword logic. \"Favor wanes. It can be rekindled.\" \n\n\"You were disarmed. Shamed. Beaten so many times by a Light-wielder.\" \n\nKelgorath stands, spinning to face Rakthrin. He thrusts a claw forward at the Wizard's throat, but she swoops back from his reach.  \n\nKelgorath sneers. \"I need no blade; I am wielded. The plates upon my body are razors.\" \n\n\"Should you have remained with Savath\u00fbn and prayed to her to give you the Light\u2026 perhaps you would have found greatness then. You wither without her favor.\" \n\n\"I spit on the Witch Sister! I am an instrument of War!\" \n\n\"Not yet. Not truly.\" \n\nRakthrin conjures a dark bolt of lightning that saps the room's dim lighting and casts it into the altar. The altar splits apart with a timbered snap, revealing an emerald sliver of a blade, bleeding shade and whispering rapture. \"A shard of the Taken King's blade. Conquered out of love. Stolen away from Saturn's shadow.\" \n\nKelgorath fixates upon the blade shard. The Wizard gestures to it with a lipless smile, and the Knight steps forward.\n\n\"I will take it. To be an instrument of her will. To cleanse the hate of weakness with loving violence.\" Kelgorath genuflects and encloses his claws around the emerald sliver, wisps of shadow spilling between the gaps in his claws. \"I offer myself to this union.\" \n\nThe barrier of his flesh melts away. A will not his own enraptures him.  \n\nKelgorath, Risen from Bones, Taken by War.",
