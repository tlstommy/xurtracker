The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

All I'll say about it is\u2014\n\nOnly one thing scares me more than dying, and that's dying inside these walls.\n\nBut I made a promise to my home.\n\nI took the three new Guardians for a tour of the tallwalk today. Two of them are blue. Actually, truly blue. I can't stop staring. Their names are Therin Vai and Nadiya. The third is an Exo, Lee-4.\n\nTherin noticed my staring and laughed at me.\n\n\"Never seen anyone this good-looking before, have you?\"\n\n\"Never seen anyone blue,\" I said.\n\nTherin tried to explain about Awoken. He didn't know much. He doesn't remember anything since becoming a Guardian.\n\n\"Then how do Guardians pick their names?\" I asked.\n\nAccording to Therin, Exo Guardians usually remember their names, but that's it. Awoken and Human Guardians remember nothing, so they just pick new names.\n\nSo I asked them why they chose theirs. Therin puffed out his chest\u2014his armor looked like it had once been really fancy, but it was scuffed and dirty from the road\u2014and said, \"Because it sounds awesome! Remember the name Therin Vai\u2014it's the name of the Guardian who will find the lost Warmind Rasputin!\"\n\nWhen he said that, Lee-4 managed to look exhausted, which is impressive for an Exo.\n\nTherin talked about Rasputin and the Baikonur for a while, so to sidetrack him I asked Nadiya where her name came from. But she just rolled her eyes. \"I don't think Micah's paying me to chitchat.\"\n\n\"You're getting paid?\" Therin said.\n\nLee-4 elbowed him hard.\n\n\"Ow! What was that for?\"\n\n\"To remind you why we're here,\" said Lee-4. It was practically the first thing I'd heard her say.\n\n\"Why are you here?\" I asked.\n\nShe fixed her electric eyes on me. \"Old debts.\"\n\n\"To Micah?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nNadiya slouched against the tallwalk parapet, her head flung back to hang over the side. I thought about pushing her over. \"Good luck with that, whatever that means,\" said Nadiya. \"I'm all about new debts. Preferably other people's debts to me.\"\n\nJust then Lee-4 swung the sniper rifle off her shoulder so fast it almost cracked Nadiya in the head. Lee-4 fitted the scope to her eye and held the weapon perfectly still, without even leaning the barrel against the wall. A pause filled only by Nadiya's complaints\u2014and then Lee fired off a shot.\n\nOn the horizon I saw a shadow fall.\n\n\"Fallen?\" said Therin.\n\n\"Kings,\" Lee confirmed.",

Your skull is now a mighty bastion. You can break anything with your skull. The only limit is your spine. Relax. The lights will speak for you. Your hands are your eyes now. Look around. You find hand-to-hand combat relaxing. The lights will attract the enemy. Help them to relax as well. You will feel the effect of a CAREGRAVER Gamma-LYSANDER-IV Health Enforcer (Frontline Variant). Your enemies do not have a skull fortress. Their skulls are like meadows. Play in the meadows. Gather the flowers from the meadows. Gather them with electrokinetic trauma. Smell the flowers.

It is a collection of Hive tomes on the nature of their runes and the rituals that they compose.\n\nI delved into the tomes immediately. They were very useful once I was able to decipher her notes, neaten the pages, and remove her blank bookmarks\u2014which I hope were not placed there for some purpose. I could not find a pattern to their insertion, even when they had arrows pointing to underlined passages.\n\nAt this point in my studies, I believe I have some insight into the way that these runes affect their magic. As Eris has explained to me, each rune is a logogram that encompasses many, and at times, contradictory meanings.  Curiously, some denote the particular Light energies used by Guardians and predate the acquisition of the Light by Savath\u00fbn's brood.\n\nThe style employed in inscribing the runes is unique to their practitioner. For instance, the runes that Eris writes follow concentric circles, while Savath\u00fbn composes long, tangential strings of runes. Runes also adorn many Hive weapons in long columns.\n\nI understand that Eris is now devising a ritual that requires the composition and empowerment of many Hive runes. I must remember to wish her luck.",

May it rise to fight again.\n\nDO-AJ: I trust you have another plan, Commander? Hopefully a more effective plan.\n\n[silence]\n\nIR: The hostility is unnecessary, Jalaal. We are here to devise a plan.\n\nDO-AJ: We had one. It was rejected. The time for that is long past.\n\nIR: Your plan was to leave the Traveler.\n\nNM-EH: We are unprepared because we waste time debating.\n\nFWC-L2: We were prepared by every conflict that befell the City. This war has been written in the stars. Let it come.\n\nDO-AJ: Mobilize the fleet. We have guns enough. Surely, that option would please Lakshmi.\n\nFWC-L2: Yes.\n\nIR: The fire from your guns would have ricocheted off the Almighty's hull. How do you plan to wound the Pyramid?\n\nCZ: This was settled during the Red War. It has not changed. We will need the fleet in reserve should the situation turn dire.\n\nNM-EH: We will not flee the seat of our Golden Age. Enact war-time powers. A Monarch must be chosen.\n\nIR: [inaudible]\n\nNM-EH: How long has that omen been left buried on the Moon? If the Commander had given us access instead of allowing that mystic to\u2014\n\nIR: Cryptarchs have been attempting to parse the Luna site data feed for months. It is digitized madness.\n\nFWC-L2: Are the Warmind's weapons operational?\n\nCZ: No. They\u2026 cannot act independently.\n\nNM-EH: So then there is nothing?\n\nCZ: When Rasputin fell, a Hidden agent was dispatched to investigate the Pyramid's nature and divine its intent. They are supported by Guardian operatives. They will work to contain the Darkness while we evacuate nearby assets and evaluate engagement strategies.\n\n[silence]\n\nCZ: In our haste to act, we were caught flat-footed. When we choose to strike again, we must be sure of its efficacy. We may only get one chance. You have all brought wisdom to this meeting. I have considered your council. Executor, I request the New Monarchy support us as they did so graciously when the Red Legion struck. Organize the movement of our people and coordinate with Suraya Hawthorne's contacts to secure them within the walls. Cousin Jalaal, I request Dead Orbit ships ferry the wayward home and provide transit security. In return, you will both be granted full access to the Vanguard's Luna site resources.\n\nNM-EH: A late invitation, but acceptable.\n\nDO-AJ: For the time being, we will protect caravans and aid in relocation.\n\nCZ: Good. Lakshmi, Project Stronghold will require additional printings. Ada-1 has agreed to lend her equipment and expertise to assist in this endeavor. Is this satisfactory?\n\nFWC-L2: Our forges are ready and eager. We request to assist the Bray in evaluating damage to the Warmind.\n\nCZ: Offer the help. Ana will accept it, I'm sure, so long as you defer to her oversight.\n\nFWC-L2: Her standing is tenuous. We believe it amicable to offer partnership, not support.\n\nCZ: You may suggest as much.\n\nIR: Do we have a consensus?\n\n[many voices pledge in agreement]\n\nIR: Adjourned.\n\n[nondescript shuffling and chatter]\n\n[door closing]\n\n[silence]\n\nIR: You offer too much. They want all the sway and none of the responsibility.\n\nCZ: Let them have both. Now is not the time to tangle ourselves in political conflicts.\n\nCZ: It won't be long before they realize Eris is the agent in question. She should be warned.\n\nIR: I'll reach out to her.",
