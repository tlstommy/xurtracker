The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

Here are the three most frequently asked questions we get about our revolutionary weaponized sound system.\n\nQ: If the Wavesplitter fires sound waves, does it need ammo packs?\n\nA: The Wavesplitter does need ammo packs, but the onboard matter transmuter turns that ammo into electrical energy that powers the waveform emitter.\n\nQ: What does it sound like when you're hit by it?\n\nA: Our Guardian testers give us many different answers. Some say it sounds like a scream you hear in your bones. Others say it sounds like a dying star. Still others say it reminds them of a knife shaped like a B flat.\n\nQ: Can the Wavesplitter be used as a musical instrument?\n\nA: The Wavesplitter was not designed to be a musical instrument. That said, we at Omolon are in the business of giving Guardians options, not taking them away.",

But when they took my Ghost\u2026 Ooh, when they took my Ghost from me\u2014that was the moment their lives ended.\n\nThey just didn't know it yet.\n\nSince my first rez, I kept to myself. Figured I'd always been that way, in my previous life and all. Joining fireteams, raiding, the Commander's Nightfalls\u2014never my bag. Always walked alone. Never needed nobody. Except for Ghost. Ghost was my only friend. Got no shame in admitting that, not anymore.\n\nNot long after the Taken War, we'd made our way to the EDZ, looking for a place to call our own. Looking for some quiet. Maybe something resembling peace. Ghost and me, we'd been fighting since the Faction Wars. Always fighting. Non-stop fighting. And I was done. We were done. We'd been running solo ops so long, I don't think anyone even noticed we were gone. And we were glad for it.\n\nOur sudden disconnect from the Light changed all that. Like it or not, I was Guardian, he was a Ghost. Peace was never in the cards; the Traveler saw to that. Ghost reconnected to the City networks for the first time in I don't know how long only to find that comms were jammed planet-wide. So we moved west\u2014to our original LZ, to head back to the City, to find the next fight. That's when they found us. The Cabal\u2014Red Legion, we would later learn.\n\nThey marched us north of the Winding Cove. Set up camp within sight of the Shard. They ingested their libations. Got rowdy. They knew we were Lightless; they wanted to see what I was really made of, when I was just meat and air. I said, do your worst. And they did. Beat me within an inch of my final life and then guffawed when Ghost couldn't do anything to get me back on my feet. They ingested more of their bevvies, and one of 'em decided I had one eye too many, and he took it and popped it and laughed some more and asked me what I was gonna do about it. I laughed back, louder and crazier than they liked, and told them I had another. Then one of them, the worst one of them, took hold of Ghost, and said, I'm your Ghost now\u2014I'm the one who decides if you live or die. Ghost was just a pebble in its meat hooks. And with no effort at all, Ghost was in pieces. Before the sun rose, they threw me off a cliff. They should have put a bullet in me. They should have fed me to their War Beasts.\n\nFigure Ghost chose me because I was some kind of hero in my before time. Maybe. More likely I was just another killer.\n\nAnd I sure as hell didn't need no Fists of Havoc to get my hands wet proper.",

It holds a mighty tribute.\" The Wizard, Rakthrin, War-Council, whispers Xivu Arath's bait to the Knight. \n\nKelgorath remembers how Savath\u00fbn sought the Sky and became its puppet, all so she could usurp sword logic. \"Favor wanes. It can be rekindled.\" \n\n\"You were disarmed. Shamed. Beaten so many times by a Light-wielder.\" \n\nKelgorath stands, spinning to face Rakthrin. He thrusts a claw forward at the Wizard's throat, but she swoops back from his reach.  \n\nKelgorath sneers. \"I need no blade; I am wielded. The plates upon my body are razors.\" \n\n\"Should you have remained with Savath\u00fbn and prayed to her to give you the Light\u2026 perhaps you would have found greatness then. You wither without her favor.\" \n\n\"I spit on the Witch Sister! I am an instrument of War!\" \n\n\"Not yet. Not truly.\" \n\nRakthrin conjures a dark bolt of lightning that saps the room's dim lighting and casts it into the altar.

Stolen away from Saturn's shadow.\" \n\nKelgorath fixates upon the blade shard. The Wizard gestures to it with a lipless smile, and the Knight steps forward.\n\n\"I will take it. To be an instrument of her will. To cleanse the hate of weakness with loving violence.\" Kelgorath genuflects and encloses his claws around the emerald sliver, wisps of shadow spilling between the gaps in his claws. \"I offer myself to this union.\" \n\nThe barrier of his flesh melts away. A will not his own enraptures him.  \n\nKelgorath, Risen from Bones, Taken by War.",

Let's just say the onboarding process could use a little streamlining. But as for our enemies, two points are drilled into us from day 1: the Cabal are big, horrible brutes, and the Fallen are untrustworthy scavengers.\n\nWhat they don't tell you right away is how that is such complete garbage. \n\nI've seen Cabal who might as well have had rocks in their heads instead of brains. The kind who'll crash a tank, killing themselves, rather than stop to reload munitions in a turret. But I've known just as many Cabal who will stalk you across the Martian dunes for two days straight\u2014no sleep, never revealing themselves. \n\nThat's how I was introduced to Bracus Dra'usk. \n\nAs for the Fallen\u2014sorry, the Eliksni\u2014everyone tells the story of the battle of Twilight Gap, of the Eliksni Houses sending in Dregs to eat babies and other charming bedtime stories. But nobody prepares you for an Eliksni so scared out of her wits that she tries praying to you because she thinks the \"Great Machine\" will listen through you. An Eliksni so inured in the old ways that she leaves an offering to you\u2014like you're some sort of saint to a lesser god. \n\nThat was how I met Chirrih. \n\nA few months before the Red War, I was two days in to a long patrol on Mars tracking a limping Skyburner tank back to a carrier rendezvous location. I got sloppy. Didn't realize that the Skyburners had a rear guard because I believed the Cabal were utter morons with the tactical acumen of a boulder. Because that's what I was taught. Not that they're a proud people with a storied history. \n\nNo, I got that driven 12 inches into my abdomen when Bracus Dra'usk, leader of the Skyburner's rear guard, ran me through with a ceremonial knife. \n\nNormally that would just be a minor inconvenience, except that during the Collapse, the Darkness chewed up large reaches of Mars so bad that Light can't burn there, in the same way that fire can't burn in space. So here I am in a Darkness Zone, bleeding out, my Ghost panicking because he can't do anything to save me, and five angry Cabal ready to throw down. \n\nNow, I killed all four of Dra'usk's honor guard without needing to reload, but Dra'usk wasn't a pushover. We went a few rounds, me bleeding everywhere, him coming at me with a Sword as long as I am tall. \n\nThat's when I saw movement in my periphery, like a heat mirage. I knew what it was, but didn't have time to react until the electrostatic sheath was already coming off. But then I realized that the Eliksni Vandal coming out of cloak wasn't coming for me\u2014it was coming for Dra'usk. \n\nYou see, what they don't teach you about Eliksni is that they're fiercely loyal when it comes to family. And Dra'usk had kidnapped and killed some of this Eliksni's kin. So here we were, two would-be enemies, taking down a Cabal Bracus like a pair of wolves. At least until I passed out from blood loss. \n\nTo my surprise, I woke up bandaged and alive. The Vandal had left a trail of scrap metal taken from Dra'usk's armor for me to follow like breadcrumbs once I was strong enough to move. My Ghost explained the Eliksni likely spared me for helping defeat a common enemy, but Ghosts aren't omniscient\u2014they're just little nerds who read a lot. Some stuff isn't written down. \n\nAt the end of the trail outside the Darkness Zone, I found the Vandal waiting for me. She introduced herself as Chirrih. I understood her, but barely\u2014she spoke in circular idioms interspersed with Eliksni words. She set down on the sand a trophy she'd crafted from Dra'usk's helmet: a Bow with enough draw strength to penetrate a tank at 100 yards. Then she sang at me\u2014some kind of mandible-clicking prayer\u2014and left. No gunfight, no bloodshed. \n\nNew Guardians tend to know two things: gun and shoot. You pick the rest up along the way, and every Guardian's experience tends to be different. \n\nMine sure was.",

And you know better than to return to me empty-handed. At least I thought you knew.\" Spider narrowed his eyes at his trembling Associate. \n\n\"I do, the Spider. I\u2026 I have information, but not about Darkness. I saw the Crow. Tailing the Golem and his crew.\" \n\n\"The Vanguard has him sniffing around Basilius, hm? So we do have something to trade with the empress after all. Not that it'll do her any good; my little bird  is devilishly hard to catch.\" Spider leaned forward. \"Now HE would've gotten me something useful from Europa. You might've learned from him.\" \n\n\"Yes, the Spider.\" Arrha nodded vigorously. The faint sounds of revelry drifted in from down the hall, where the other Associates were enjoying their week's earnings. \n\n\"Avrok already told me about Crow's new assignment as Vanguard agent. Apparently, he's placed quite the wager on one of the Cabal's silly Rites ,\" the Spider chuckled. \"Avrok should've dared him to bet his freedom. Could stand to win my whole trove, he's that valuable.\" \n\n\"Yes, the Spider,\" Arrha repeated. Out of corner of his eye, he could see his share of Ether waiting in the corner. \n\n\"Oh, take your wages and go. I ought to dock you for bringing me nothing, but I'm feeling generous this week.\" Spider's voice dropped into a growl. \"Remember that I am good to you, Arrha.\" \n\nArrha nodded as he scrambled to grab his Ether tanks and get out. Finally alone, the Spider sat back in his throne. \n\n\"It's Crow, really, that needs the reminder,\" he mused aloud. \"I wonder how I might give it to him?\"",

The stench of the Taken permeated her nostrils: ozone, gun lubricant, and the sickly sweet burn of soulfire.\n\nThe fusion rifle sounded again, closer this time. The shot was met with garbled hisses and return gunfire as the Taken rallied.\n\nAfter her abandonment, Sjari had tried to move as little as possible so as not to attract the attention of the Taken patrols that periodically swept the area. But the fighting moved closer, now a dozen meters from her hiding place. She quieted her fear and let her mind go lax, encouraging them to overlook her.\n\nShe had staved off the prying minds of the Taken Psions by lowering her heart rate and entering a deep meditative trance, sometimes for many hours at a time. But each time she re-emerged into her body, its demands became harder to ignore. She was desperate for food, for water, for anything.\n\nDespite all her training, she was nearing the end of her resolve. Until she heard a voice\u2014a soft, clear whisper in her ear: \"Have faith, my Techeuns. You are lost, but not forgotten. Help is on the way.\"\n\nIt seemed that Queen Mara's promise would finally come to pass. There was yet hope.",
