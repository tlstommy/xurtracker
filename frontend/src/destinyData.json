The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

I have completed my sweep through the Reef and am filing an incident report hence forth referred to as Inc-01, should it be referenced.\n\nShuffling is heard as the speaker adjusts. Papers sift and the microphone crackles slightly. \n\nRc-9: The basis of my visit to the Tangled Shore was to conduct routine Vanguard/Reef security sweeps, as agreed upon since the day of incursion. I was escorted most of the way to the Shore by Awoken gunships, and only landed once my long-range scanner picked up a sub-audio reading emanating from the underbelly of one of the larger asteroid landmasses. \n\nThe speaker clears their throat. \n\nRc-9: I called in the disturbance to a nearby Awoken vessel and was told to, and I quote, \"Mind my own business and be on my way,\" so naturally, I thanked them for their assistance, feigned departure, and landed to check it out. They didn't seem to notice the signal. At the signal's source, I discovered a small camp of what I initially thought were Scorn. Upon further observation, I found that these were not Scorn but Fallen afflicted with some kind of flesh deformity and mental degradation. Shot one dead and the others just looked at me. They didn't fight back. Fired a few cesium charges into the asteroid hole and watched 'em burn. Just sat there. I didn't hear it clearly, but they were chanting something. I don't know. Hard to hear over the fire. \n\nThe speaker laughs to themselves and emulates popping noises. \n\nRc-9: I heard more of them whispering a little deeper in, so I waited for the area to burn out and continued inside. I found one structure of apparent Hive architecture, though it did not appear to have been constructed in any traditional sense\u2026 but then again, I don't know what I should even expect from the Hive at this point. A single Fallen was inside, became violent when I approached and brandished a weapon. The weapon was not loaded, and I put them down. \n\nRc-9: My logs will show a few recovered pieces of equipment that I will list now. One presumably organic section of the Hive structure. It is perpetually wet, just\u2026 great job on that, and causes dizziness and blurred vision when held with ungloved hands. It also has the unnerving ability to project dysphoria or general unease. I was asked to collect a sample for study by my CO. I've done that. Put it in a lead box all the way in the back of the cargo hold. Yeah. Eternal tithings to Xivu Arath. Whatever. Um\u2026 as I was saying. \n\nA tin is heard being unlatched. \n\nRc-9: Also recovered: one tube-style Grenade Launcher. It has no foundry markings. Definitely not Fallen, and I don't think the Scorn even know how to make weapons. Do the Awoken make Grenade Launchers? Always struck me as a Human weapon. Beautiful weapon. The thing wants to be used. Maybe I'll get an opportunity to use it before I get back to the Tower. Lastly, I recovered a locational tracker from one of the Fallen. Following it back to someplace else in the Reef. Little remote. I'll call in my findings once I've finished there. \n\nRc-9: Beautiful weapon. \n\nThe recording cuts.",

Why didn't you chase them down?\"\n\nBrivi kneels in front of Spider, all four of his palms on the ground. \"Their Pikes remained. They are outside. Just the crew was gone. And the crates.\" He does his best to appear compliant by tamping down his quills. \n\n\"Gone. In the middle of the Reef. On foot. With over a million Glimmer in weapons. Something about this doesn't add up.\" Spider motions to Avrok and Ahrrha, who advance on Brivi with Molten Welders raised. \"But we'll get to the truth of things soon enough.\" \n\nBrivi begins to panic. \"Please, Baron Spider. If it were not truth, I would not come back.\" Avrok prepares to melt off one of Brivi's upper arms, and looks to the Spider for the order. \n\nBefore Spider can speak, Crow steps forward from the wings. \"If I may, my Baron\u2026\" \n\nSpider gestures for Avrok to hold, and turns his attention to the Lightbearer. \"What is it? If you don't have the stomach for my discipline, you have permission to leave the room.\" \n\n\"It's not that, Baron. It's just that Brivi's account is consistent with several other instances Glint and I have seen out on the Reef. We think it has something to do with those Hive constructs.\" Crow spares a sympathetic glance toward the prostrate Brivi. \"Besides, what Brivi says is true. If he were in on the theft, he wouldn't have come back. If you'll just allow Glint and me to retrace his steps, we may find out what happened to the road crew. Who knows\u2026 we may even retrieve the weapons.\" \n\nSpider relaxes in his throne. \"Very well, Crow. Go find my weapons. And if you locate the road crew, you know what to do.\" \n\n\"Yes, Baron.\" Crow turn on a heel and strides from the room. \n\nBehind him, he hears the Spider growl, \"Avork, you may proceed.\"",

The fact that you think you can interpret what has driven dozens to insanity doesn't give me a good deal of confidence in your decision-making abilities, and I can't keep my concerns internal any longer. We don't need another Sundaresh in the upper ranks.\n\nI don't care if you saw the Red War before it happened. What would you say of the several other unfruitful predictions you conveniently ignore now?\n\nI have listened to your speeches and read your many messages calling for support. I understand you believe the future is at stake, and we are supposed to do something about that. Fear over the Fallen is not the future this organization was meant to combat. Your paranoia won't change my mind.\n\nMy children were harassed in the streets today for daring to bring food to the Eliksni Quarter. They came home in tears, and I wonder how long until it becomes worse. I won't be a part of spreading that fear. I won't participate in splitting this City and turning it against itself. I'm well aware of the dangers posed by Fallen Houses, but the City remains strong because we stand together.\n\nYou're a student of history. You know how the Iron Lords converted Warlords into dutiful servants of the Light. Lord Shaxx alone should speak to the value of that effort. If a Fallen House wants to stand with us against their own\u2014just like the Warlords of old, just like Fallen in the Reef did\u2014who are you to tell them no?\n\nArmies, we can keep out. The Guardians will hold the wall. That danger is nowhere close to the death from within that you are stoking. If it all falls apart, just remember Mithrax didn't fire the first shot. You did.\n\nConsider this my resignation,\n\nNovarro",

They were perhaps the most delicious thing Ikora had tasted in the last 20 years. And while the two of them worked their way through the jar, Mithrax uncomfortably stumbled his way to his question.\n\n\"Eris Morn has changed,\" he said carefully, and Ikora nodded. \"She chose to change, and she acted out of\u2026 is there a Human word for 'love-bravery'?\"\n\nIkora smiled. \"Love,\" she said.\n\n\"Love, then,\" Mithrax nodded. \"If she were to change forever, if she cannot return to herself, will she be remembered well? Since her first choice was made from love?\"\n\nIkora responded as though she had not struggled with the thought a thousand times already. \"Eris will always be Eris, no matter what form she takes,\" she said.\n\nMithrax harrumphed in satisfaction and leaned forward to take another leech. \"Yes. I am always impressed with the resilience of the Guardians, with or without their Light. Saint tells me the Titan Sloane embraced the Taken, and she is doing well.\"\n\n\"Yes, and for that, I am grateful,\" Ikora said. \"But\u2026 they don't always come back, Mithrax. An old friend of mine was corrupted by the Vex in a similar way. He stayed behind when the Pyramids attacked, just like Sloane. But I believe we lost him.\"\n\n\"I am sorry about your friend,\" Mithrax said somberly. \"I hope he is remembered as a hero.\"\n\nIkora raised her eyebrows but said nothing.\n\n\"I, too, encountered a great mind consumed by the Vex,\" Mithrax continued. \"The Guardian and I attempted a rescue, but it went deeper into the network as it gained the access it sought. It taught me that the pursuit of truth is worth any price\u2014even one's own sense of self.\"\n\nIkora smiled. \"Asher would have agreed with every word of that.\"\n\nMithrax leaned forward in amazement, a leech dangling limply from his claws. \"You knew Ashermere?\"\n\nIkora cocked her head. \"Yes, Asher Mir. How on earth did you know him?\"\n\n\"Asher\u2026 Mir,\" Mithrax said slowly to himself, mimicking Ikora. \"That is why I have been unable to locate any records.\"\n\n\"Ikora,\" he said, straightening himself in his seat, \"I must tell you a story about our friend, Asher Mir, the hero.\"",

Instead, the Guardian surged through the air, dodging explosion after explosion. Their Light seared through the Scorn, burning them alive.  \n\nIt wasn't long before the smoke cleared and the Guardian stood alone, their Light thrumming with tithes. Immaru grumbled to himself.  \n\nFor as long as he'd been a Ghost, he'd resented how the Guardians referred to the Light. It was never \"my Ghost's Light\" or \"the Traveler's Light.\" No\u2014it was always \"MY Light.\" They talked about it like they owned it. Like they were entitled to it. Like they earned it. \n\nBut looking down at the smoldering battlefield, Immaru had to admit that the Guardians' arrogance served them well. It gave them the confidence to mold their Light in the fashion that suited them best. They treated it like a tool\u2014something to be used. That gave them an advantage over the Lucent Brood, whose manipulation of the Light was inhibited by reverence. \n\nImmaru turned away from the ritual circle in disgust. He hated to admit it, but the Lucent Brood had a lot to learn about the Light from the Guardians.  \n\nAnd once they did, the Humans would pay for their lack of respect.",

The feed he was about to watch could easily be misconstrued.  \n\nAs it was, the City smoldered with rumors from citizens and Guardians alike. The persistent, undulating hole in the Traveler's side put everyone on edge. Hearing that Vanguard leadership was using Hive magic to fulfil a bargain put forth by the Witch Queen would undoubtedly stoke the flames of panic. \n\nZavala leaned grimly over his desk to watch the Guardian's latest tithes to Eris Morn.  \n\nIt used to be simple, he lamented. We exterminated the Hive wherever we found them, and we felt good about it. Justified. But in recent years, morally ambiguous situations like these had become more common, and separating friend from foe was increasingly difficult. \n\nOver the feed, Eris Morn's face lit up with fierce elation as the Guardian's tithes flowed through her. Her Hive form seemed to swell with power. Zavala knew that Eris undertook the rituals with temperance, at least for now, but he wondered how long her clarity would last. Elsie Bray's warnings had been too vivid to dismiss entirely, even after Ikora's reassurances. \n\nZavala turned away from the feed to gaze out the window at the Traveler. The trauma puncturing its side reminded him of the stakes. The reasons they were taking such risks. \n\nHe sighed, wondering how many more compromises they would have to make before the end.",

The feed he was about to watch could easily be misconstrued.  \n\nAs it was, the City smoldered with rumors from citizens and Guardians alike. The persistent, undulating hole in the Traveler's side put everyone on edge. Hearing that Vanguard leadership was using Hive magic to fulfil a bargain put forth by the Witch Queen would undoubtedly stoke the flames of panic. \n\nZavala leaned grimly over his desk to watch the Guardian's latest tithes to Eris Morn.  \n\nIt used to be simple, he lamented. We exterminated the Hive wherever we found them, and we felt good about it. Justified. But in recent years, morally ambiguous situations like these had become more common, and separating friend from foe was increasingly difficult. \n\nOver the feed, Eris Morn's face lit up with fierce elation as the Guardian's tithes flowed through her. Her Hive form seemed to swell with power. Zavala knew that Eris undertook the rituals with temperance, at least for now, but he wondered how long her clarity would last. Elsie Bray's warnings had been too vivid to dismiss entirely, even after Ikora's reassurances. \n\nZavala turned away from the feed to gaze out the window at the Traveler. The trauma puncturing its side reminded him of the stakes. The reasons they were taking such risks. \n\nHe sighed, wondering how many more compromises they would have to make before the end.",

There's nothin' you can do except put up with me.\"\n\nEris returned to her work, raising a hand and pushing him out of the way. He huffed, watching her as she resumed sharpening the points of the staff's base.\n\n\"With this, the Guardian may devise rituals of their own. It will empower their Light and channel the Hive's vile power.\"\n\n\"You're welcome,\" Immaru said smugly.\n\nEris ignored him and examined the staff she had crafted. It represented hours spent sliding a blade's edge over layers of dead, porous Hive chitin, carving it with spells and imbuing it with magic. At its head was soulfire ichor, encased in vitreous Light. A gleaming vessel.\n\n\"One last reagent.\"\n\nShe turned back to her worktable. The worm squirmed and squealed under her knife.",

The feed he was about to watch could easily be misconstrued.  \n\nAs it was, the City smoldered with rumors from citizens and Guardians alike. The persistent, undulating hole in the Traveler's side put everyone on edge. Hearing that Vanguard leadership was using Hive magic to fulfil a bargain put forth by the Witch Queen would undoubtedly stoke the flames of panic. \n\nZavala leaned grimly over his desk to watch the Guardian's latest tithes to Eris Morn.  \n\nIt used to be simple, he lamented. We exterminated the Hive wherever we found them, and we felt good about it. Justified. But in recent years, morally ambiguous situations like these had become more common, and separating friend from foe was increasingly difficult. \n\nOver the feed, Eris Morn's face lit up with fierce elation as the Guardian's tithes flowed through her. Her Hive form seemed to swell with power. Zavala knew that Eris undertook the rituals with temperance, at least for now, but he wondered how long her clarity would last. Elsie Bray's warnings had been too vivid to dismiss entirely, even after Ikora's reassurances. \n\nZavala turned away from the feed to gaze out the window at the Traveler. The trauma puncturing its side reminded him of the stakes. The reasons they were taking such risks. \n\nHe sighed, wondering how many more compromises they would have to make before the end.",
