The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

With each detail, her blood pounded more forcefully in her ears and the Light tingled in her fingertips. Now, striding across the elevated catwalk, her temper nearly lifted her off the ground in righteous fury. \n\nSuddenly a deep, familiar voice broke through the tumult: \"Anger bends the mind, as gravity bends space-time. It's a form of distortion\u2014useful, but dangerous.\" Ikora turned, half expecting to find Osiris standing behind her. But she was still alone. \n\n\"Like gravity, once anger reaches a critical mass, it collapses in on itself, and not even Light can escape.\" Ikora smiled to herself. Even in absentia, her mentor always knew just what to say. \n\nIkora Rey ducked into an alcove and sat with her back against the cool stone of the Tower. She closed her eyes and listened to her breath. Concentrated on slowing her heartrate. Felt her muscles loosen. \n\nOnce her body was stilled, she completed one of the many meditations Osiris taught her when she first began her training. She felt the Light moving through her body: first as a raging fire, then as a rushing river, and finally as a cool breeze. By the time she opened her eyes, her mind was clear and sharp. \n\nShe was prepared to face her opponent. \n\nII. \n\nSaint-14 was doing munitions inventory when Osiris swept into the room. Saint put down his datapad next to a crate of grenades and stood up. Osiris scanned the shelves of guns and ammo, looking for something. \n\nSaint stood dumbly, waiting for some kind of acknowledgement. When it was clear that none was forthcoming, he called out, \"Osiris. What are you looking for?\" His voice was loud and strained. \n\nOsiris didn't turn from the shelves. \"The Light suppressor that the Psions used on Zavala's Ghost. I need it for my research.\" \n\n\"Zavala kept it, I think. Ask him about it,\" Saint replied, trying not to sound put out. \n\nOsiris faced his partner, his eyes narrowed in thought. \"Very well.\" Then, as an afterthought, \"Thank you.\" \n\nAs the former Warlock turned to leave, Saint called out, \"I was hoping we could spend some time together soon. Just the two of us.\" \n\n\"Doing what?\" Osiris inquired with a small smile. \n\n\"We could fly out to the Alps,\" Saint suggested. \"Or walk around the ruins of Prague. Like we used to.\" \n\n\"That seems fine,\" Osiris said. He shrugged a shoulder. \"Provided the City doesn't burn to the ground in our absence.\" Then after a beat: \"Is that all?\" \n\nIs that all? Behind his helmet, Saint frowned. \"I suppose.\" \n\nOsiris strode from the room, leaving Saint alone with a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. \n\nIII. \n\nLakshmi-2 watched Osiris from across the bustling courtyard. Of all the political creatures in the Tower, he was the one that troubled her most. \n\nHer concern was not a matter of the ex-Warlock's unpredictability. In fact, it was just the opposite. \n\nThe Device had no trouble parsing his arrogant brilliance\u2014his every move was well within the standard deviation. \n\nYet for someone with a legendary reputation as an eccentric, his every move as of late had been shockingly moderate. It was his newfound predictability that bothered her. \n\nPerhaps the loss of his Ghost had affected him more than anyone understood. Maybe the burden of mortality had sapped his courage. \n\nIt was also possible that Osiris represented a blind spot in the Vex dataset; something that only a Human could comprehend. Or perhaps instead, something obvious to the Vex overlooked by her Human mind. \n\nWhatever the case, Osiris bore watching the old-fashioned way. At least until his usefulness played out.",

                "ExtLore": "The harsh buzz of a sawtooth wave jolted Ekris from slumber. He groaned, slid off his cot, and slumped into the pilot's chair. Large amounts of data streamed across an array of thick glass screens while the alarm blared. He connected all the various details: heavy interference on scanners, propulsion malfunction in the main drive, erroneous flags on the proximity detectors. He looked through the porthole, a glass circle no more than five inches wide, and saw wisps of blue particulates wash past.\n\n\"Collision?\" he pondered.\n\nA voice called out behind him. \"Still days out from the belt, nothing here to hit.\"\n\nEkris pivoted around and saw his copilot. He squinted, trying to remember the other Eliksni's name, but nothing came to him. He felt bad about that. They'd been in transit awhile and he still couldn't remember this one's name.\n\n\"It's Raksil,\" the copilot said as he focused on the instrument displays. \"You make that face every time you forget my name.\"\n\nEkris looked away in shame. \"Strange coincidence. Had a brother Raksil.\"\n\n\"There are many Raksil-brothers and Ekris-pilots, if you look far enough,\" the copilot said.\n\nEkris wasn't convinced that was true, but it wasn't important.\n\n\"Drive is down,\" Ekris said. \"Stuck in a field of something.\"\n\n\"Not stuck,\" Raksil said as he punched in some commands through the dash controls, stopping the alarm. \"Just slow. Velocity steady.\"\n\n\"No control\u2026\" Ekris chittered nervously. \"If we're lucky, we'll drift out eventually.\"\n\n\"Long road just to get to Misraaks.\" Raksil sat on the bulkhead and sighed. \"You still think he's Kell of Kells?\"\n\nEkris' mind buzzed with an odd sensation. He didn't remember sharing that with his copilot.\n\n\"Best chance I've seen,\" he said. \"He is different, brings us together in new ways.\"\n\nRaksil made a click with his mandible. \"Heard that before.\"\n\nEkris waved his claw dismissively. \"You always dissent, just to be a dissenter.\"\n\n\"I want to free you from this obsession,\" Raksil replied.\n\nEkris scoffed. \"Kell of Kells is a symbol of hope for all Eliksni. You would rather we live without that?\"\n\n\"This myth divides us, brother,\" Raksil said. \"We rend and tear, trying to claw our way to the top of the mountain. Then we look down and see the mountain is made of our torn banners.\"\n\nSomething itched in Ekris's mind. Did Raksil just call him \"brother\"?\n\nRaksil continued his thought. \"The only unity down this path is collective death. The Kell of Kells is destined to rule only the House of Silence.\"\n\nEkris clicked his jaw angrily. \"Why would Eliksni dream of this Kell, if the dream only harms us?\"\n\n\"Maybe we didn't,\" Raksil said with a devilish grin. \"Maybe something else dreamt it for us. To keep us apart.\"\n\nEkris waved his claws and stood, pacing around the cabin. \"Enough. You are stretched thin by this journey; you need more sleep\u2014go to your bunk.\" His mind itched again. There was only one cot in the ship. He stumbled as the dizziness overcame his senses. When he looked up, he was alone.\n\n\"You've chased this dream so long you've forgotten you're asleep,\" Raksil said, a hint of mourning in his voice\u2014the sound came from nowhere in particular. The pilot's console was dim and quiet. The instrument readouts had slowed and showed no warnings. Ekris looked toward the porthole and saw nothing but black, peppered with the sparse glimmer of distant stars.",

His Light was already all the advantage needed to ensure the status quo.\n\nBut hunger could cause people to act irrationally, an oversight in Citan's philosophy, and soon they were banging down the doors of his stronghold. In a display of utter dominance, Citan allowed the doors to open, personally standing between his people and the warmth and comfort of his Hall.\n\n\"My home is open to any with the will to earn it. You only need get past me.\" His hands sparked with Arc Light.\n\nOut of desperation, one brave soul made a meager attempt to dart past the towering Warlord.

Her fresh lungs\u2014still not desensitized to the burn of cordite\u2014spasmed as she coughed, but her Ghost was the only soul left to see her moment of awkward human frailty. \n\nThe Titan righted herself and tested taking a few deep breaths before scanning the room. Cryomagma expelled by nearby ice volcanoes began to fall as snow through the open ceiling, slightly obscuring her view of the starry river cascading through the Milky Way. The off-white powder flurried down into the rubble and highlighted the scattered white and blue bits of Seraphite shards. Cal slung her Shotgun and began to collect them. \"Can you scan for the rest of these, Winter?\"\n\nHer Ghost chirped and rotated on her central axis. \"What are you\u2026 Are those the pieces of your old helmet?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Need to put it back together,\" Cal said and brushed the crystallized solution of water and ammonia from a concrete slab, placing the recovered pieces with a surgeon's care. \"It's my fault for getting caught with my helmet off.\"\n\n\"We have a real objective,\" her companion huffed. \"I can make you a new helmet!\"\n\n\"I like this helmet.\"\n\n\"It's covered in Cabal viscera,\" Winter protested as Cal continued to pluck shards from the ruined floor. \n\n\"A little wash, a little Glimmer, a new environmental seal; it'll be good as new.\"\n\n\"Cal, it's been shattered. It's useless.\"\n\nThe Titan tore a scrap of Cabal banner free and began to carefully wrap the pieces. \"I was broken when you found me. Am I useless?\"\n\n\"You don't want me to answer that honestly right now.\"\n\nCal pointedly ignored the Ghost's comment.\n\n\"Of course not,\" Winter finally relented. \"Your old wounds helped me determine what kind of person you were. You can't remember it, but the damage to your femur and vertebrae suggested you were a person who could press forward despite phenomenal pain. Your scars told me what you could do.\"\n\n\"That's why it's important for me to remember: I am what I've been through,\" Cal countered while prying a final piece of regulator out from under an Incendior's boot.\n\n\"The footprints are not the dance,\" Winter corrected.\n\n\"Out of all the Ghosts in Sol, I get the poet.\"\n\n\"What I mean is, you are more than what you survive. Your scars,\" the Ghost clarified, \"told me you were someone who could endure. They didn't tell me how. They also didn't tell me about your morals. Your sense of humor. Your generosity. But eventually, you did.\"\n\n\"There's more to me than being broken.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nCal cooed over the last piece of helmet, which still bore a tiny, childish drawing of a heart. The initials within, MG, were visibly scuffed. \"So maybe there's a little more to my helmet too.\"",

Between the Vanguard's support, generous contributions from the Awoken, and several upgrades courtesy of a lapsed Dead Orbit adherent, the ship's a lot to be entrusted with. \n\n\"These new sensors are something else,\" Isidro announces from the cockpit. \"If so much as a mouse sneezes out there in the black, we'll pick it up.\"\n\nRahila squints at him. \"A mouse?\"\n\n\"Space-mice. Or, you know, a gravitational anomaly. Or mysterious, freaky signals.\" \n\n\"Vanguard will be along in a few to see us off.\" Roche-5's composed baritone emerges from the hatch leading to the cargo hold. \"You two ready?\" \n\n Rahila settles into the copilot's chair. \"To go find out what's left of our solar system? 'Course we are.\" \n\n\"Remember,\" Roche intones gravely, \"This is pure recon. No big risks.\" \n\nRahila and Isidro exchange grins. \"Sure thing.\"",

We are born with no one but our Ghosts, and we find our way to something more. I was lucky to find my way to a family. A family I chose for myself.\n\nI was drawn to the Speaker because of the vision he had for this City. He helped me understand that we fight not for the sake of fighting, but for the sake of the people. He taught me to imagine a day where we might put down our weapons and that reaching that day would be our greatest victory yet. I have worked for that day all my life.\n\nThe Speaker was a leader in this City. He was here at its formation. He helped establish the Consensus. Most importantly, he was a figure that people could recognize and trust. Because of him, that is what I aspire to be as well: a familiar face who reminds people that they are safe. That they are taken care of.\n\nIt is painful for me\u2014and for all of us\u2014that we could not be there during the Speaker's last moments. As Guardians, it is the nature of our long lives that we see many people die. We hope that, through our service, we can give them peaceful deaths. At the very least, we know that the Speaker died bravely. We know that he died with the City, the people, and the Traveler in his mind. We know that his last moments were a testament to everything this City stands for: bravery in the face of adversity and dedication to our principles when faced with those who would do us harm.\n\nWe cannot reclaim what we have lost. There will always be a void that the Speaker once filled. We cannot replace him.\n\nBut I hope, someday, we may find someone to continue his work.\n\nFather, I will miss you. I am sorry for the times that I failed you. I have been given a second chance, and I will use it to live up to the ideals you thought you saw in me. I will not let you down.\n\nThank you.\n\n\u2014Eulogy for the Speaker of the Last City, given by Saint-14, on the day of the Speaker's memorial service",

He feared it would reveal him as the imposter and infiltrator he was, even while dressed as a House Salvation deserter.\n\nDuring the approach to Earth, Ahrrha had been overawed. The Last City looked like a perfect ripple of Light from above, dropped from the impassive form of the Great Machine. Ahrrha wondered for the first time in his life if the Spider was wrong about the Guardians.\n\nBut his misgivings evaporated as soon as he emerged from the drop ship. Rather than living in a gleaming city of crystal, the Eliksni were packed into the bombed-out ruins of a former war zone. The area they'd been \"given\" appeared to be on the verge of collapse. \n\nAhrrha sneered inwardly. Did the Guardians really believe that the Eliksni could be pacified so cheaply? That they were content to live under the boots of the Vanguard, gnawing at scraps? Perhaps it was true for fools like Misraaks, his Awoken-raised hatchling, and cowards like the Empty Weaver. \n\nBut the Spider's acquiescence would not be so easily bought. In fact, Ahrrha thought, the Spider could probably own this settlement within a year. The generosity and goodwill of House Light would soon crumble to greed and hubris, as they all did. And once Spider's syndicate had a foothold, they would make the Vanguard pay. In Glimmer, weapons, Ether, and blood.",

You're sorely, and soon to be regretfully, mistaken.\"\n\nSola spits in Aunor's face. \"You have limits. You have masters.\" A twisted Light shimmers in Sola's hand as she moves to attack. \"Enjoy hanging to death in your strings!\"\n\nAunor pulls the trigger unflinchingly. Sola drops. \"Disgrace of a Warlock.\"\n\nSola's Ghost hangs motionless in the air beside her dead charge. A breeze rustles char from the patches of blackened grass around them. Her iris flicks next to the two Praxic watchdogs: the Warlock who pulled the trigger and the Titan partner who shakes a recent death from his bones.\n\nAunor turns to her colleague. \"Should we have her resurrected and ask again?\"\n\nThe Titan wipes blood from his chest plate as his Ghost patches his armor. A fresh bullet hole sits above his heart. \"No, I think she made herself clear the first time.\"\n\nSola's Ghost pipes up, \"Who says I would?\"\n\n\"You have nothing to fear, Little Light. Your Guardian is\u2026 touched. We are here to help.\"\n\n\"You mean you're here to put us down.\"\n\n\"Not presently. Give us the coordinates of your heading. Then, you will be escorted to the City in peace.\"\n\n\"You know. If you didn't, you wouldn't be here.\"\n\n\"We've tracked the gravitational disturbances, yes. The Warmind had revealed the anomaly was moving through the outer system. But you know that, and you know how to find it.\"\n\nThe Ghost mimics a \"spit\" noise. \"Run back to your quiet Traveler. I won't be ordered around anymore!\"\n\nAunor's body deflates as she holsters her weapon. \"Bahaghari\u2026\" she says. A Ghost appears at Aunor's side. \"Prepare our tools. This one appears touched as well.\"\n\nBahaghari nods and slips away to follow the order.\n\nThe Striker Titan approaches and snaps his  fingers. A stunning bolt of lightning pelts Sola's Ghost out of the air into unconsciousness. \"It's affecting Ghosts now too. We should bring them back to the City. This makes five.\"\n\nHe picks up the Ghost and shoulders Sola's body before shuffling off to their ship.\n\nAunor turns to follow. \"Five, and counting,\" she whispers to herself without taking her eyes off Sola's Ghost.",
