The bonfire's glow lights up his pale features and I am drawn to the hope in his gold eyes. Where is the despairing child I anticipated?\n\nHe drinks from an open bottle of wine against the recommendation of his Ghost. The Guardian encourages him and they are laughing. This celebration is maddening; neither have reason to be so jubilant. Their world is ending and they thrash like dying creatures in the final light of collapsing stars. They do not seem to acknowledge the futility of their existence, the impermanence of it in the face of cosmic annihilation.\n\nNow the Guardian is drinking, standing close to the fire. Their Ghost, too, encourages them not to partake. They poison themselves for the enjoyment of it.\n\nI am reminded of my sisters. Of moments spent by lapping shores, gazing up at infinite stars full of possibilities and wonder. I am left yearning.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not understand it. I do not want it.\n\nThey are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.\n\nAs equals.\n\nI am reminded of my home. I am reminded of the warmth of the sun and the embrace of my family. I am reminded of my father's face. I am reminded of everyone I betrayed. All the blood spilled in the name of immortality. The warmth of the sun burns me with its memory.\n\nWhat is this feeling?\n\nI do not want it.\n\nThe fire has nearly died. The Crow fell over and cannot stand, though he insists he is fine. The Guardian is turning the embers with the tip of their Sword. The Ghosts are talking to one another in quiet conspiracy. The celebration has ended, but I can sense their emotions are mixed: complex and myriad things, when a simple, singular focus would suffice.\n\nThere is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.\n\nWhat is this feeling?",

His voice was hoarse.\n\nDrifter looked up at the swirling mass of egregore and his thoughts shifted back to Eris Morn. They'd found a little comfort with each other. A little understanding. But what did it look like, he wondered, when all that chitin burst out of her? What did it feel like to eat up all those tithes the Guardians were taking for her in the field? In the Crucible? In Gambit?\n\nHe'd read the reports. He saw the theories on VanNet. He didn't trust them. He trusted her.\n\nDrifter nodded to himself and took a breath as he heard the Guardians assemble behind him. He stepped up on the platform, flicking his jade coin. It spun in the air, catching the light, before falling back into the Drifter's waiting palm.\n\n\"You ever eat Hive eyes?\" he asked with a smile, twisting his wrist around and slipping the coin back into his sleeve.\n\n\"Real juicy. They go pop in your mouth, and a shiver runs all the way through\u2026 Heh. I'll tell you when you're older.\"\n\nHe winked. The assembled Guardians watched him in silence. \n\n\"Transmat firing!\" he called out, and they disappeared in a burst of light.",

The one your hounds have hidden away in that quaint little vault.\" Sola smiles red through split lips. \"You're on the losing side.\"\n\n\"Do you think you have nothing to lose, or that I wouldn't take it from you? You're sorely, and soon to be regretfully, mistaken.\"\n\nSola spits in Aunor's face. \"You have limits. You have masters.\" A twisted Light shimmers in Sola's hand as she moves to attack. \"Enjoy hanging to death in your strings!\"\n\nAunor pulls the trigger unflinchingly. Sola drops. \"Disgrace of a Warlock.\"\n\nSola's Ghost hangs motionless in the air beside her dead charge. A breeze rustles char from the patches of blackened grass around them. Her iris flicks next to the two Praxic watchdogs: the Warlock who pulled the trigger and the Titan partner who shakes a recent death from his bones.\n\nAunor turns to her colleague. \"Should we have her resurrected and ask again?\"\n\nThe Titan wipes blood from his chest plate as his Ghost patches his armor. A fresh bullet hole sits above his heart. \"No, I think she made herself clear the first time.\"\n\nSola's Ghost pipes up, \"Who says I would?\"\n\n\"You have nothing to fear, Little Light. Your Guardian is\u2026 touched. We are here to help.\"\n\n\"You mean you're here to put us down.\"\n\n\"Not presently. Give us the coordinates of your heading. Then, you will be escorted to the City in peace.\"\n\n\"You know. If you didn't, you wouldn't be here.\"\n\n\"We've tracked the gravitational disturbances, yes. The Warmind had revealed the anomaly was moving through the outer system. But you know that, and you know how to find it.\"\n\nThe Ghost mimics a \"spit\" noise. \"Run back to your quiet Traveler. I won't be ordered around anymore!\"\n\nAunor's body deflates as she holsters her weapon. \"Bahaghari\u2026\" she says. A Ghost appears at Aunor's side. \"Prepare our tools. This one appears touched as well.\"\n\nBahaghari nods and slips away to follow the order.\n\nThe Striker Titan approaches and snaps his  fingers. A stunning bolt of lightning pelts Sola's Ghost out of the air into unconsciousness. \"It's affecting Ghosts now too. We should bring them back to the City. This makes five.\"\n\nHe picks up the Ghost and shoulders Sola's body before shuffling off to their ship.\n\nAunor turns to follow. \"Five, and counting,\" she whispers to herself without taking her eyes off Sola's Ghost.",

But as she walked outside to a flash, this time there was no thunder. \n\nIt had taken Sloane most of the morning after the Guardian had left to reach the surface. Waves were overtaking the rig platform, sloshing methane across the battle-marred power suit woven into Sloane's body. \n\n\"Hell\u2026\" She straightened her spine within the suit and stared at the Pyramid through her HUD, watching it displace existence around it as it clawed a distorted path through the sky.   \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in zoomed toward her through a blur of flickering neon. \"Moving away from us.\" \n\n\"Shouldn't be moving at all.\" Sloane turned to her Ghost. \"Let's get that perimeter set. The Hive'll come again tonight.\" \n\nBefore she could move, the Pyramid began shedding Scales from its hull. They hovered for a moment over where they'd detached and peeled away, revealing opalescent flesh. \n\nSuddenly, the Pyramid emitted a wave that struck Titan, and a half-remembered tone resonated through Sloane's mind. With it, a lifetime: every experienced moment in a slurry of vivid flashes, condensed into simultaneous chaotic anarchy, grasping at grief, joy, anger, love. Seen from where she stood, past experiences gained new perspectives; memories best left dusted with rosy haze shrank under harsh light. Warmth, too fleeting, cold, still, ever frigid in its isolation\u2026  \n\nAnd something else, sifting through it all, drawing it to order, as if rearranging fractured collagic panes into a new image.  \n\nShe struggled to breathe, and her suit flexed against the weight of her years, splayed out across time in violating fashion. Then just as suddenly, they were gone, faded into dreams.  \n\nThe sky turned black and orange like a fire-screen, and thunder resonated. \n\nSloane's body pitched forward over the platform, sinking through air, then sea. Heavy metal was swallowed whole; consciousness faded into the black. \n\nHer experience tumbled through sharded eras of reality like an astral projection, even as she felt her feet still firmly planted in the present. A cascade of timeless scenes whirled by, like panes of life captured in glass, in an indefinite stream of consciousness. Scenes of Titan, of a vibrant seascape installation. Too familiar not to be memories. \n\nNot hers, but no less real. \n\nTheir point of focus left Titan, dragged backwards across the lonely expanse of space to a world she'd never seen.  \n\nIts seas full of vivacious promise. Its moons conceal a Watcher in the sky. Its waves breed insidious appetite in the deep. \n\nThere is a temptation there she craves but does not understand. Unnatural and cursed. \n\nShe fell again, guided. Through a song, a memory, an image of a dream bent into perception like a focusing lens. Unreality coated in familiar skin. An attempt at understanding. \n\nThe Tower. Friends and comrades. Shine and grime, all. A heralded return. A shadow drawn overhead. A battle delayed, returning. \n\nThe Tower, a time yet lived. Black shadows that would fill an empty void in the sky, extending impaling blades down into the streets. Pinning life in paralytic mockeries of contentment. A display that strangles agency. \n\nA serpent winds a path beneath the shadow and offers to guide.  \n\nShe remembered this happening, and that it had not yet happened.",

She dragged a hand through methane fluid to her faceplate, absentmindedly trying to rub the grogginess from her eyes.  \n\nMotion in the dark surrounding her kicked up clouds of fine grit.  \n\nHer headlights flared as her fingertips clinked against her helmet\u2014a Thrall came screaming into the beam of light, bubbles spewing from its jaws. Sloane's eyes went wide before she reflexively flipped the Thrall over her shoulder and kicked its jaw through its skull. Her power suit spooled and pushed stimulants reactively. \n\nShe pivoted and caught the sword of a Knight mid-swing, snapping the weapon in two between the fingers of her gauntlet and driving a shard of broken blade into its chest. Another Thrall crossed her headlights just before a silver streak whistled through its throat. Sloane eyed a selection in her visor, which hi-lighted over thirty dead Hive, slowly deteriorating in boils of tiny, rumbling ignitions that sent nerve-spasms through their husks. Her visor cleared the readings and snapped onto a friendly.  \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in drifted forward, Hive viscera gently wafting into the sea from the slender razors protruding from her shell. \"You were out for days.\" \n\nSloane's face wrinkled in confusion. \"I remember the Pyramid wave. Falling\u2026 dreams. Are you okay?\" \n\n\"Hive found us, like you said,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in said, retracting her blades. \n\nSloane grabbed the Ghost and hugged her to her power suit chassis for a moment. \"Little killer. Really gave 'em the business.\" \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in chirped. \"Pyramid wave swept over Titan, bounced around a bit and centralized where the Pyramid stopped. Gravity went crazy, then the ocean. I think we're a few miles from where we were when all this started.\" \n\n\"The Pyramid stopped? Then that's where we're headed\u2026 after we grab some gear,\" Sloane said. \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in dipped forward. \"One more thing. Something's out there circling us. Not Hive. Can't quite pin it down, but it's big.\" \n\n\"Yeah?\" Sloane said, thinking of what went through her mind before she lost consciousness. \"Then let's not waste any time getting out of here.\" \n\n*** \n\nSloane lifted herself from the ocean onto a half-submerged Arcology platform where she'd stowed a variety of rations and munitions since Titan's skies went dark. Her power suit clattered against the steel-mesh floor; she waited for the echoes to die down before taking a moment to exhale in silence. In that quiet moment, she made out a faint voice.  \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in rose into view. \"Do you hear that?\" \n\n\"Was about to ask you\u2026\" Sloane said, standing. She snatched First In, Last Out from a stow locker, racked the foregrip, then followed the voice down a barnacle-crusted causeway to an old research lab with S\u00edoch\u00e1in in tow. \n\nFluid trickled down cracked walls surrounding rows of dead monitors. Glass reflected prismatic color from a gnarled tear in reality at the lab's center\u2014as if it had been carved from another epoch and affixed to this one.  \n\nA Human that didn't seem to notice them paced within the tear\u2014standing in a fully functioning mirage of the Arcology. Once he turned toward them, the tear spasmed and lurched forward and backward in time at erratic durations and speed. He was ripped both ways into non-existence as the tear flittered through events like a fourth-dimensional montage. \n\nThe tear held steady again, returning the man and his moment to existence. S\u00edoch\u00e1in took note of the badge on his coat that read \"Gideon Tepin\u2014NPA\u2014Senior Marine Biologist.\" \n\nTepin looked upset and turned away before speaking. \"She's afraid. That's why we're all having them. Something's wrong. She's showing us what's coming in plain view!\" The man angrily swiped his hand through the air in Sloane's direction. \"It's like she's screaming it into my head. I know I'm not the only one hearing it.\"  \n\n\"It chose us.\" He stepped forward and placed his hand on the border between then and now. \"I'm dreaming my own memories, but with little differences. Little omens. Black ships in the sky.\" \n\nSloane leaned forward, hand nearly pressed to that of the living memory playing out before her on the other side of the tear. \n\n\"She's trying to warn us. We should evacuate. We have to get her\u2014\" \n\nThe tear lurched again, ripped away; lost to the rushing passage of time and blinked into non-existence. Gone. \n\nSloane dropped her hand. Jaw clenched. \"See if you can dig up any Arcology records on this.\" \n\n*** \n\n\"That marine biologist\u2026 Tepin\u2026 was he in some sort of captured time fluctuation? Is that\u2026 even possible?\" Sloane asked. \n\n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in said. \"I'm not really sure.\" \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in skimmed archived reports. \"It's under 'TLev-01.' Looks like a psychic space whale some biologists were studying out in the ocean. They never got accurate measurements, but this estimate can't be correct. Over 150 meters? Report says it wasn't from here though, and refers to a lot of visions that personnel were having\u2026 which is\u2026 odd? Not a lot of alien species in Sol until after the Golden Age.\" \n\n\"I was having dreams while I was out, S\u00edoch\u00e1in. Of some other world, the Pyramid on Titan\u2026 the Tower. Like I remembered being there for each one.\" \n\n\"Well, I guess it could be an ancient space whale\u2026 or sometimes the Traveler gives people dreams. But are we going to ignore the obvious 'you were rendered unconscious by a Pyramid wave' explanation?\" \n\n\"No\u2026 but we've seen enough weird not to knock it,\" Sloane sighed.  \n\n\"Sure. I'll log that away,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in said. \"You know\u2026 the readings coming from inside that field Tepin was in were consistent with atmospheric records on Titan during the Collapse.\" \n\n\"What does that mean?\" Sloane looked back to the spot of warped space-time. \"Was he\u2026 real?\" \n\n\"I don't know. I just know it wasn't a simulation.\"",

                "ExtLore": "Sloane deftly maneuvered across the open ocean floor. Together with her Ghost, she'd chased the Pyramid's signals across Titan, but arrived too late at each coordinate site. They'd encountered nothing more than further wounds in the fabric of reality; slivered glimpses into moments held in Titan's memory. Occasionally, discarded Shrieker cores littered a site\u2014evidence of a ritual gone cold, but not so cold that S\u00edoch\u00e1in couldn't detect figments of resonant residue that drove her scanners haywire. \n\nMore than once, Sloane had found a clutch of disoriented Fallen scattered around these wounds, some in a stupor, most driven violently mad. S\u00edoch\u00e1in said their brain patterns were fractured\u2014synapses burnt into conflicting circuited loops\u2014as if their collection of experiences had been dissected and left disparate and apart.  \n\nBut Sloane felt drawn, across the barren seafloor, to each new site shrouded in sunless shadow. Something cut through that Dark. Guided her. As if she drafted behind a rogue wave. \n\n\"We're almost to the next site,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in said. \n\n\"Let's pick it up.\" The methane flowed over Sloane's armor in a slick, slipstream current that left a long tail of particulate floating in her wake, agitated by oxygen bubbles spurting from her mask. S\u00edoch\u00e1in followed close behind, sweeping the area with light beams that dissipated over vast, featureless depths. \n\n\"Resonant Pyramid energy, neutrino dispersals, and some kind of\u2026 quantum entangling? That's the best I can make of it,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in said, razor blades deployed. \"The Pyramid's moving again.\"  \n\n*** \n\nThe site seemed quiet on the surface. Sloane glanced over a sea cliff and tapped S\u00edoch\u00e1in, who had been leering out at the expansive of dark ocean as if she was tracking something.  \n\n\"You ready?\"  \n\nThe Ghost turned to Sloane and hesitantly tilted her shell into a nod. \n\nThey killed their lights, allowing the bio-luminescent coral around them to illuminate the path down to a newly split-open gorge infested with Taken corruption. Sloane swapped her visor to a thermal targeting overlay and slipped over the edge of the chasm. Tendrils of Taken malignance flowed from the split ground beneath her, dancing in the methane like noxious filaments. The fissure looked large enough for her to finagle her suit through safely.  \n\nSloane glanced over her shoulder and held up a hand to S\u00edoch\u00e1in. \"Watch my back\u2026 from a distance.\" \n\n\"Uh, no. I can fight,\" she bit back defiantly. \"Fallen, Hive, and Taken are all over this sector.\" \n\n\"Lie low on this one. If something goes wrong, it can't go wrong with you. Get me?\" \n\nShe landed in a small cavern where a tangle of Taken threads writhed around a decrepit Hive sigil of resilient witchcraft. Whispers spewed from the sigil, wrapped around her mind, coaxed her forward. She reached a hand toward the sigil, and methane burst around her like depth charges as Taken blights manifested a small detachment of soldiers. \n\nSloane spun, her fists crackling with lightning\u2014her fingers weaving her Arc Light safely through the methane around her. She charged the first of three blights, thruster-dodging incoming fire pinged by her HUD. She broke through the blight screen, planted her feet, and threw a lightning punch like a gauss cannon, atomizing the Taken and the blight itself. Her power suit carried her fulgurate fists from hostile to hostile in rising, truculent battle-fervor. \n\nWhen the cavern quieted, Sloane turned back to the sigil and called S\u00edoch\u00e1in down. \"I can\u2026 hear the Taken through this sigil\u2026 thing. It's like they're broadcasting out loud. Not in words but\u2026 their proximity, like sonar. Can you tap into it?\" \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in's concerned response was muffled by an intrusive thought echoing from somewhere far off, circling the sea around her and draining off into her mind. \n\n|Take| \n\n|Live| \n\nSloane thought of the ocean shelves crawling with the Pyramid's minions, their rituals and corruption sinking deeper into Titan's mantle by the day. Of the armies they threatened to summon, of what they searched for in the deep. \n\nShe thought of the Fallen who had no way to flee, shocked into madness by the reality-wounding waves that swept over Titan like a grey-matter line. A terminator of experience, via suspension within it. With this foreknowledge of her enemies' plans, maybe she could be a step ahead of dusk. \n\n|Take| \n\n |Live| \n\nSloane stepped forward, dazed\u2014her mind drowning in the ocean's dangers\u2014and gripped the sigil. The rippling Taken energy immediately backfired in a blinding burst of energy. \n\n\"No!\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in dove forward in horror as Taken tendrils twisted around Sloane's armor and dragged her to the ground.  \n\n\"SLOANE!\" \n\nAs tendrils buried themselves into her flesh, Sloane heard a new voice, clear as sirens in a storm. \n \nWARRIOR OF THE SKY.  \n\nYOU ARE KNOWN TO ME.  \n\nI ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENGE.",

                "ExtLore": "\"There's nothing to hide behind!\" Sloane laughed sardonically over comms, annoyance building in her voice. She made a point of spinning in the empty, expansive ocean, exoskeleton-encased arms out wide, before turning to her Ghost. They'd been walking through desolate nothingness for days, tracking the next site. \"We need to keep hitting them.\" \n\n\"It's been over a year of chasing Pyramid waves, of the blight. You're getting worse.\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in's shell cut like fins through the methane, \"And there IS something out there. It's been trailing us, or ahead of us\u2026\" \n\n\"I know. It's something old.\" Sloane's voice was flat. \"I told you; I think it's been talking to me. Or\u2026 more like thinking at me.\" Silence hung over them for a moment before being swept away by the current. \n\n\"Oh\u2026 is it now? Care to share more about that?\" the Ghost asked with restrained frustration. \n\n\"Whatever's out there\u2026 I think it's guiding us. Or trying to see if it can trust us. If we're\u2026 compatible?\" \n\n\"Oh, that's good and vague,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in hissed. \"You're sure that's what it wants? Because we have a HIVE GOD chasing us. We don't have the luxury of guessing wrong.\" \n\n\"It's just a feeling\u2014not really my thing\u2014but my gut tells me it's well-intentioned. Xivu Arath, on the other hand\u2014\" \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in dropped onto the seafloor sand. \"THAT'S what we've been following? Your gut? You think you can charge into fight after fight on a 'feeling' and keep walking away?\"   \n\n\"Isn't that the idea? I'm effectively immortal.\" Sloane stopped, turned, and shook her head. \"The suit's wearing. Rations are\u2026 look, we need to finish the mission while I'm still in fighting condition.\" \n\n\"Titan's gone, Sloane.\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in rose and drifted past her. \"What happens if you die somewhere too dark to drag you back? Have you considered that?\" \n\n\"This coming from the gung-ho Ghost, taking on the whole Hive army with a set of shaving razors.\" Sloane chuckled to herself. \"Seriously, are you expecting to live through\u2026 whatever this is?\" \n\n\"No,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in said meekly. \"I hoped you would.\" \n\nThe firm lines of Sloane's expression crumbled for an instant. \n\nThis was unlike them. \n\nShe shut her visor, cleared her throat, and turned to continue marching. \"No more fighting, for you. That's an order.\" \n\n\"But that's\u2014I was saying that to you!\" The Ghost zipped forward. \"Hey! Don't walk away from me!\" \n\nSloane stopped. The heavy metal around her boots sank into the silty sea floor. \"I'm not\u2014there's NOWHERE to walk away TO! That's MY point!\" Sloane jabbed a finger at her Ghost.  \n\n\"I'm not starving to death for an eternity just to turn out like the psycho that runs Gambit\u2026 if I even make it that far. But you don't have to worry about that. Let me be useful while I can. Then move on when it's over.\" \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in whirred in thought for a moment. \"I don't want to make it without you.\" \n\n\"We don't get to choose that.\" Sloane straightened her stance. \"If you can't take it when it hits you, you go out and hit it before it gets started.\" Sloane raised her visor and met S\u00edoch\u00e1in's stare. \"That's the best plan I have while I'm still walking. You have a better one?\" \n\n\"\u2026No.\" \n\n\"Then let's get to work.\"",

All the weight of Titan's ocean around her was nothing compared to the pressure of Xivu Arath's will pinning her down.\u202f \n\nA horde of gnashing Hive bore lipless smiles around a single Taken Knight. He stood tall before her, brandishing a gleaming blade that anchored an oppressive terrace of sharpened obsidian. The terrace loomed over their heads. A voice cut through the gnashing\u2014eager-toned, like running blood.\u202f\u202f \n\nSOLDIER OF THE SKY, YOUR STRENGTH WANES, YOUR STRATEGY TOO OBVIOUS.\u202f \n\nYOU TOOK WITHOUT CLAIM, AND NOW I CLAIM YOU.\u202f \n\nTHE SKY, DRAWN TO FALL ONCE MORE, PINNED BY NIGHT'S BLADE.\u202f \n\nSUMMON YOUR MEAGER LIGHT, YOUR SKY TETHER, YOU ARE DEFEATED.\u202f \n\nXivu's voice rose from her projection, booming from the Black Terrace with laughter like screaming fear.\u202f \n\nYOUR BEARER NEEDS YOU, GHOST.\u202f \n\nBE BRAVE.\u202f \n\nSloane felt needles of intent thread between the gaps in her armor, hook into her muscles, and slowly peel away the power suit's deep-set rivets from inset bone. A violent unraveling to a slow and painful end.\u202f \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in watched the torture from rocky concealment, razors extended, waiting for an opportunity to strike. Minutes felt like hours, but Sloane clung to life in a cloud of crimson-tinged mist.\u202f\u202f \n\nDelirium and agony fogged Sloane's mind, but an offer pierced through the cacophony of War. She heard it in her mind as if she had thought it herself. A broken promise:\u202f \n\n|Bond|\u202f \n\n|Live|\u202f \n\nShe considered the offer.\u202f \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in rushed forward, unwilling to watch any longer, and whirled through a swarm of Thrall with her blades. If she could reach Sloane, if she could just cut her free\u2014\u202f \n\nXivu Arath shrieked with whetted laughter.\u202f \n\nTHIS MORSEL IS MINE TO CONSUME.\u202f \n\nLances of pure onyx thrust through the sea to impale the little Light. The Terrace bulged and surged forward, swelling, as if to burst. For a moment, S\u00edoch\u00e1in believed Xivu Arath would burst through the Black Terrace herself, wielding a blade in corporeal hand; War's presence emanated with such strength.\u202f\u202f \n\nInstead, a gargantuan serpent crashed through the projection and snatched the Knight into its cavernous jaws as it surged by, shattering the Terrace's connection to the Knight. Eruptions of soulfire swallowed the Terrace and branched through the methane as the projection imploded on itself. The serpent dove, its enormous form overtaking and dwarfing the crumbling Terrace projection. It twisted above them, unfurling a portion of its tail to sweep aside scores of Hive with ease and sending plumes of sediment into a thick, obfuscating fog.\u202f \n\nSloane collapsed, and S\u00edoch\u00e1in rushed to her side, cutting through an Acolyte before it could raise its shredder. \"We need to go! Get up!\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in exclaimed and began stitching Sloane's gushing wounds and mending bones where she could. All around them, the Hive fired wildly into the sea, the soulfire pops of their deaths spurring tiny, muted explosions as it reacted with liquid methane.\u202f \n\nBefore S\u00edoch\u00e1in could get Sloane to her feet, the serpent slammed down in front of them, belly first, and shielded them from retaliatory Hive salvos. S\u00edoch\u00e1in darted in front of Sloane, razors ready against this giant beast, but the serpent simply looked at the Titan, its massive eye spanning more than three of her, shoulder to shoulder. Once more, Sloane heard the promise in her mind.\u202f \n\n|Bond|\u202f \n\n|Live|\u202f \n\nAnd so, they struck an accord.",

But as she walked outside to a flash, this time there was no thunder. \n\nIt had taken Sloane most of the morning after the Guardian had left to reach the surface. Waves were overtaking the rig platform, sloshing methane across the battle-marred power suit woven into Sloane's body. \n\n\"Hell\u2026\" She straightened her spine within the suit and stared at the Pyramid through her HUD, watching it displace existence around it as it clawed a distorted path through the sky.   \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in zoomed toward her through a blur of flickering neon. \"Moving away from us.\" \n\n\"Shouldn't be moving at all.\" Sloane turned to her Ghost. \"Let's get that perimeter set. The Hive'll come again tonight.\" \n\nBefore she could move, the Pyramid began shedding Scales from its hull. They hovered for a moment over where they'd detached and peeled away, revealing opalescent flesh. \n\nSuddenly, the Pyramid emitted a wave that struck Titan, and a half-remembered tone resonated through Sloane's mind. With it, a lifetime: every experienced moment in a slurry of vivid flashes, condensed into simultaneous chaotic anarchy, grasping at grief, joy, anger, love. Seen from where she stood, past experiences gained new perspectives; memories best left dusted with rosy haze shrank under harsh light. Warmth, too fleeting, cold, still, ever frigid in its isolation\u2026  \n\nAnd something else, sifting through it all, drawing it to order, as if rearranging fractured collagic panes into a new image.  \n\nShe struggled to breathe, and her suit flexed against the weight of her years, splayed out across time in violating fashion. Then just as suddenly, they were gone, faded into dreams.  \n\nThe sky turned black and orange like a fire-screen, and thunder resonated. \n\nSloane's body pitched forward over the platform, sinking through air, then sea. Heavy metal was swallowed whole; consciousness faded into the black. \n\nHer experience tumbled through sharded eras of reality like an astral projection, even as she felt her feet still firmly planted in the present. A cascade of timeless scenes whirled by, like panes of life captured in glass, in an indefinite stream of consciousness. Scenes of Titan, of a vibrant seascape installation. Too familiar not to be memories. \n\nNot hers, but no less real. \n\nTheir point of focus left Titan, dragged backwards across the lonely expanse of space to a world she'd never seen.  \n\nIts seas full of vivacious promise. Its moons conceal a Watcher in the sky. Its waves breed insidious appetite in the deep. \n\nThere is a temptation there she craves but does not understand. Unnatural and cursed. \n\nShe fell again, guided. Through a song, a memory, an image of a dream bent into perception like a focusing lens. Unreality coated in familiar skin. An attempt at understanding. \n\nThe Tower. Friends and comrades. Shine and grime, all. A heralded return. A shadow drawn overhead. A battle delayed, returning. \n\nThe Tower, a time yet lived. Black shadows that would fill an empty void in the sky, extending impaling blades down into the streets. Pinning life in paralytic mockeries of contentment. A display that strangles agency. \n\nA serpent winds a path beneath the shadow and offers to guide.  \n\nShe remembered this happening, and that it had not yet happened.",

She dragged a hand through methane fluid to her faceplate, absentmindedly trying to rub the grogginess from her eyes.  \n\nMotion in the dark surrounding her kicked up clouds of fine grit.  \n\nHer headlights flared as her fingertips clinked against her helmet\u2014a Thrall came screaming into the beam of light, bubbles spewing from its jaws. Sloane's eyes went wide before she reflexively flipped the Thrall over her shoulder and kicked its jaw through its skull. Her power suit spooled and pushed stimulants reactively. \n\nShe pivoted and caught the sword of a Knight mid-swing, snapping the weapon in two between the fingers of her gauntlet and driving a shard of broken blade into its chest. Another Thrall crossed her headlights just before a silver streak whistled through its throat. Sloane eyed a selection in her visor, which hi-lighted over thirty dead Hive, slowly deteriorating in boils of tiny, rumbling ignitions that sent nerve-spasms through their husks. Her visor cleared the readings and snapped onto a friendly.  \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in drifted forward, Hive viscera gently wafting into the sea from the slender razors protruding from her shell. \"You were out for days.\" \n\nSloane's face wrinkled in confusion. \"I remember the Pyramid wave. Falling\u2026 dreams. Are you okay?\" \n\n\"Hive found us, like you said,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in said, retracting her blades. \n\nSloane grabbed the Ghost and hugged her to her power suit chassis for a moment. \"Little killer. Really gave 'em the business.\" \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in chirped. \"Pyramid wave swept over Titan, bounced around a bit and centralized where the Pyramid stopped. Gravity went crazy, then the ocean. I think we're a few miles from where we were when all this started.\" \n\n\"The Pyramid stopped? Then that's where we're headed\u2026 after we grab some gear,\" Sloane said. \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in dipped forward. \"One more thing. Something's out there circling us. Not Hive. Can't quite pin it down, but it's big.\" \n\n\"Yeah?\" Sloane said, thinking of what went through her mind before she lost consciousness. \"Then let's not waste any time getting out of here.\" \n\n*** \n\nSloane lifted herself from the ocean onto a half-submerged Arcology platform where she'd stowed a variety of rations and munitions since Titan's skies went dark. Her power suit clattered against the steel-mesh floor; she waited for the echoes to die down before taking a moment to exhale in silence. In that quiet moment, she made out a faint voice.  \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in rose into view. \"Do you hear that?\" \n\n\"Was about to ask you\u2026\" Sloane said, standing. She snatched First In, Last Out from a stow locker, racked the foregrip, then followed the voice down a barnacle-crusted causeway to an old research lab with S\u00edoch\u00e1in in tow. \n\nFluid trickled down cracked walls surrounding rows of dead monitors. Glass reflected prismatic color from a gnarled tear in reality at the lab's center\u2014as if it had been carved from another epoch and affixed to this one.  \n\nA Human that didn't seem to notice them paced within the tear\u2014standing in a fully functioning mirage of the Arcology. Once he turned toward them, the tear spasmed and lurched forward and backward in time at erratic durations and speed. He was ripped both ways into non-existence as the tear flittered through events like a fourth-dimensional montage. \n\nThe tear held steady again, returning the man and his moment to existence. S\u00edoch\u00e1in took note of the badge on his coat that read \"Gideon Tepin\u2014NPA\u2014Senior Marine Biologist.\" \n\nTepin looked upset and turned away before speaking. \"She's afraid. That's why we're all having them. Something's wrong. She's showing us what's coming in plain view!\" The man angrily swiped his hand through the air in Sloane's direction. \"It's like she's screaming it into my head. I know I'm not the only one hearing it.\"  \n\n\"It chose us.\" He stepped forward and placed his hand on the border between then and now. \"I'm dreaming my own memories, but with little differences. Little omens. Black ships in the sky.\" \n\nSloane leaned forward, hand nearly pressed to that of the living memory playing out before her on the other side of the tear. \n\n\"She's trying to warn us. We should evacuate. We have to get her\u2014\" \n\nThe tear lurched again, ripped away; lost to the rushing passage of time and blinked into non-existence. Gone. \n\nSloane dropped her hand. Jaw clenched. \"See if you can dig up any Arcology records on this.\" \n\n*** \n\n\"That marine biologist\u2026 Tepin\u2026 was he in some sort of captured time fluctuation? Is that\u2026 even possible?\" Sloane asked. \n\n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in said. \"I'm not really sure.\" \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in skimmed archived reports. \"It's under 'TLev-01.' Looks like a psychic space whale some biologists were studying out in the ocean. They never got accurate measurements, but this estimate can't be correct. Over 150 meters? Report says it wasn't from here though, and refers to a lot of visions that personnel were having\u2026 which is\u2026 odd? Not a lot of alien species in Sol until after the Golden Age.\" \n\n\"I was having dreams while I was out, S\u00edoch\u00e1in. Of some other world, the Pyramid on Titan\u2026 the Tower. Like I remembered being there for each one.\" \n\n\"Well, I guess it could be an ancient space whale\u2026 or sometimes the Traveler gives people dreams. But are we going to ignore the obvious 'you were rendered unconscious by a Pyramid wave' explanation?\" \n\n\"No\u2026 but we've seen enough weird not to knock it,\" Sloane sighed.  \n\n\"Sure. I'll log that away,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in said. \"You know\u2026 the readings coming from inside that field Tepin was in were consistent with atmospheric records on Titan during the Collapse.\" \n\n\"What does that mean?\" Sloane looked back to the spot of warped space-time. \"Was he\u2026 real?\" \n\n\"I don't know. I just know it wasn't a simulation.\"",

                "ExtLore": "Sloane deftly maneuvered across the open ocean floor. Together with her Ghost, she'd chased the Pyramid's signals across Titan, but arrived too late at each coordinate site. They'd encountered nothing more than further wounds in the fabric of reality; slivered glimpses into moments held in Titan's memory. Occasionally, discarded Shrieker cores littered a site\u2014evidence of a ritual gone cold, but not so cold that S\u00edoch\u00e1in couldn't detect figments of resonant residue that drove her scanners haywire. \n\nMore than once, Sloane had found a clutch of disoriented Fallen scattered around these wounds, some in a stupor, most driven violently mad. S\u00edoch\u00e1in said their brain patterns were fractured\u2014synapses burnt into conflicting circuited loops\u2014as if their collection of experiences had been dissected and left disparate and apart.  \n\nBut Sloane felt drawn, across the barren seafloor, to each new site shrouded in sunless shadow. Something cut through that Dark. Guided her. As if she drafted behind a rogue wave. \n\n\"We're almost to the next site,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in said. \n\n\"Let's pick it up.\" The methane flowed over Sloane's armor in a slick, slipstream current that left a long tail of particulate floating in her wake, agitated by oxygen bubbles spurting from her mask. S\u00edoch\u00e1in followed close behind, sweeping the area with light beams that dissipated over vast, featureless depths. \n\n\"Resonant Pyramid energy, neutrino dispersals, and some kind of\u2026 quantum entangling? That's the best I can make of it,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in said, razor blades deployed. \"The Pyramid's moving again.\"  \n\n*** \n\nThe site seemed quiet on the surface. Sloane glanced over a sea cliff and tapped S\u00edoch\u00e1in, who had been leering out at the expansive of dark ocean as if she was tracking something.  \n\n\"You ready?\"  \n\nThe Ghost turned to Sloane and hesitantly tilted her shell into a nod. \n\nThey killed their lights, allowing the bio-luminescent coral around them to illuminate the path down to a newly split-open gorge infested with Taken corruption. Sloane swapped her visor to a thermal targeting overlay and slipped over the edge of the chasm. Tendrils of Taken malignance flowed from the split ground beneath her, dancing in the methane like noxious filaments. The fissure looked large enough for her to finagle her suit through safely.  \n\nSloane glanced over her shoulder and held up a hand to S\u00edoch\u00e1in. \"Watch my back\u2026 from a distance.\" \n\n\"Uh, no. I can fight,\" she bit back defiantly. \"Fallen, Hive, and Taken are all over this sector.\" \n\n\"Lie low on this one. If something goes wrong, it can't go wrong with you. Get me?\" \n\nShe landed in a small cavern where a tangle of Taken threads writhed around a decrepit Hive sigil of resilient witchcraft. Whispers spewed from the sigil, wrapped around her mind, coaxed her forward. She reached a hand toward the sigil, and methane burst around her like depth charges as Taken blights manifested a small detachment of soldiers. \n\nSloane spun, her fists crackling with lightning\u2014her fingers weaving her Arc Light safely through the methane around her. She charged the first of three blights, thruster-dodging incoming fire pinged by her HUD. She broke through the blight screen, planted her feet, and threw a lightning punch like a gauss cannon, atomizing the Taken and the blight itself. Her power suit carried her fulgurate fists from hostile to hostile in rising, truculent battle-fervor. \n\nWhen the cavern quieted, Sloane turned back to the sigil and called S\u00edoch\u00e1in down. \"I can\u2026 hear the Taken through this sigil\u2026 thing. It's like they're broadcasting out loud. Not in words but\u2026 their proximity, like sonar. Can you tap into it?\" \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in's concerned response was muffled by an intrusive thought echoing from somewhere far off, circling the sea around her and draining off into her mind. \n\n|Take| \n\n|Live| \n\nSloane thought of the ocean shelves crawling with the Pyramid's minions, their rituals and corruption sinking deeper into Titan's mantle by the day. Of the armies they threatened to summon, of what they searched for in the deep. \n\nShe thought of the Fallen who had no way to flee, shocked into madness by the reality-wounding waves that swept over Titan like a grey-matter line. A terminator of experience, via suspension within it. With this foreknowledge of her enemies' plans, maybe she could be a step ahead of dusk. \n\n|Take| \n\n |Live| \n\nSloane stepped forward, dazed\u2014her mind drowning in the ocean's dangers\u2014and gripped the sigil. The rippling Taken energy immediately backfired in a blinding burst of energy. \n\n\"No!\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in dove forward in horror as Taken tendrils twisted around Sloane's armor and dragged her to the ground.  \n\n\"SLOANE!\" \n\nAs tendrils buried themselves into her flesh, Sloane heard a new voice, clear as sirens in a storm. \n \nWARRIOR OF THE SKY.  \n\nYOU ARE KNOWN TO ME.  \n\nI ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENGE.",

                "ExtLore": "\"There's nothing to hide behind!\" Sloane laughed sardonically over comms, annoyance building in her voice. She made a point of spinning in the empty, expansive ocean, exoskeleton-encased arms out wide, before turning to her Ghost. They'd been walking through desolate nothingness for days, tracking the next site. \"We need to keep hitting them.\" \n\n\"It's been over a year of chasing Pyramid waves, of the blight. You're getting worse.\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in's shell cut like fins through the methane, \"And there IS something out there. It's been trailing us, or ahead of us\u2026\" \n\n\"I know. It's something old.\" Sloane's voice was flat. \"I told you; I think it's been talking to me. Or\u2026 more like thinking at me.\" Silence hung over them for a moment before being swept away by the current. \n\n\"Oh\u2026 is it now? Care to share more about that?\" the Ghost asked with restrained frustration. \n\n\"Whatever's out there\u2026 I think it's guiding us. Or trying to see if it can trust us. If we're\u2026 compatible?\" \n\n\"Oh, that's good and vague,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in hissed. \"You're sure that's what it wants? Because we have a HIVE GOD chasing us. We don't have the luxury of guessing wrong.\" \n\n\"It's just a feeling\u2014not really my thing\u2014but my gut tells me it's well-intentioned. Xivu Arath, on the other hand\u2014\" \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in dropped onto the seafloor sand. \"THAT'S what we've been following? Your gut? You think you can charge into fight after fight on a 'feeling' and keep walking away?\"   \n\n\"Isn't that the idea? I'm effectively immortal.\" Sloane stopped, turned, and shook her head. \"The suit's wearing. Rations are\u2026 look, we need to finish the mission while I'm still in fighting condition.\" \n\n\"Titan's gone, Sloane.\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in rose and drifted past her. \"What happens if you die somewhere too dark to drag you back? Have you considered that?\" \n\n\"This coming from the gung-ho Ghost, taking on the whole Hive army with a set of shaving razors.\" Sloane chuckled to herself. \"Seriously, are you expecting to live through\u2026 whatever this is?\" \n\n\"No,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in said meekly. \"I hoped you would.\" \n\nThe firm lines of Sloane's expression crumbled for an instant. \n\nThis was unlike them. \n\nShe shut her visor, cleared her throat, and turned to continue marching. \"No more fighting, for you. That's an order.\" \n\n\"But that's\u2014I was saying that to you!\" The Ghost zipped forward. \"Hey! Don't walk away from me!\" \n\nSloane stopped. The heavy metal around her boots sank into the silty sea floor. \"I'm not\u2014there's NOWHERE to walk away TO! That's MY point!\" Sloane jabbed a finger at her Ghost.  \n\n\"I'm not starving to death for an eternity just to turn out like the psycho that runs Gambit\u2026 if I even make it that far. But you don't have to worry about that. Let me be useful while I can. Then move on when it's over.\" \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in whirred in thought for a moment. \"I don't want to make it without you.\" \n\n\"We don't get to choose that.\" Sloane straightened her stance. \"If you can't take it when it hits you, you go out and hit it before it gets started.\" Sloane raised her visor and met S\u00edoch\u00e1in's stare. \"That's the best plan I have while I'm still walking. You have a better one?\" \n\n\"\u2026No.\" \n\n\"Then let's get to work.\"",

All the weight of Titan's ocean around her was nothing compared to the pressure of Xivu Arath's will pinning her down.\u202f \n\nA horde of gnashing Hive bore lipless smiles around a single Taken Knight. He stood tall before her, brandishing a gleaming blade that anchored an oppressive terrace of sharpened obsidian. The terrace loomed over their heads. A voice cut through the gnashing\u2014eager-toned, like running blood.\u202f\u202f \n\nSOLDIER OF THE SKY, YOUR STRENGTH WANES, YOUR STRATEGY TOO OBVIOUS.\u202f \n\nYOU TOOK WITHOUT CLAIM, AND NOW I CLAIM YOU.\u202f \n\nTHE SKY, DRAWN TO FALL ONCE MORE, PINNED BY NIGHT'S BLADE.\u202f \n\nSUMMON YOUR MEAGER LIGHT, YOUR SKY TETHER, YOU ARE DEFEATED.\u202f \n\nXivu's voice rose from her projection, booming from the Black Terrace with laughter like screaming fear.\u202f \n\nYOUR BEARER NEEDS YOU, GHOST.\u202f \n\nBE BRAVE.\u202f \n\nSloane felt needles of intent thread between the gaps in her armor, hook into her muscles, and slowly peel away the power suit's deep-set rivets from inset bone. A violent unraveling to a slow and painful end.\u202f \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in watched the torture from rocky concealment, razors extended, waiting for an opportunity to strike. Minutes felt like hours, but Sloane clung to life in a cloud of crimson-tinged mist.\u202f\u202f \n\nDelirium and agony fogged Sloane's mind, but an offer pierced through the cacophony of War. She heard it in her mind as if she had thought it herself. A broken promise:\u202f \n\n|Bond|\u202f \n\n|Live|\u202f \n\nShe considered the offer.\u202f \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in rushed forward, unwilling to watch any longer, and whirled through a swarm of Thrall with her blades. If she could reach Sloane, if she could just cut her free\u2014\u202f \n\nXivu Arath shrieked with whetted laughter.\u202f \n\nTHIS MORSEL IS MINE TO CONSUME.\u202f \n\nLances of pure onyx thrust through the sea to impale the little Light. The Terrace bulged and surged forward, swelling, as if to burst. For a moment, S\u00edoch\u00e1in believed Xivu Arath would burst through the Black Terrace herself, wielding a blade in corporeal hand; War's presence emanated with such strength.\u202f\u202f \n\nInstead, a gargantuan serpent crashed through the projection and snatched the Knight into its cavernous jaws as it surged by, shattering the Terrace's connection to the Knight. Eruptions of soulfire swallowed the Terrace and branched through the methane as the projection imploded on itself. The serpent dove, its enormous form overtaking and dwarfing the crumbling Terrace projection. It twisted above them, unfurling a portion of its tail to sweep aside scores of Hive with ease and sending plumes of sediment into a thick, obfuscating fog.\u202f \n\nSloane collapsed, and S\u00edoch\u00e1in rushed to her side, cutting through an Acolyte before it could raise its shredder. \"We need to go! Get up!\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in exclaimed and began stitching Sloane's gushing wounds and mending bones where she could. All around them, the Hive fired wildly into the sea, the soulfire pops of their deaths spurring tiny, muted explosions as it reacted with liquid methane.\u202f \n\nBefore S\u00edoch\u00e1in could get Sloane to her feet, the serpent slammed down in front of them, belly first, and shielded them from retaliatory Hive salvos. S\u00edoch\u00e1in darted in front of Sloane, razors ready against this giant beast, but the serpent simply looked at the Titan, its massive eye spanning more than three of her, shoulder to shoulder. Once more, Sloane heard the promise in her mind.\u202f \n\n|Bond|\u202f \n\n|Live|\u202f \n\nAnd so, they struck an accord.",

But as she walked outside to a flash, this time there was no thunder. \n\nIt had taken Sloane most of the morning after the Guardian had left to reach the surface. Waves were overtaking the rig platform, sloshing methane across the battle-marred power suit woven into Sloane's body. \n\n\"Hell\u2026\" She straightened her spine within the suit and stared at the Pyramid through her HUD, watching it displace existence around it as it clawed a distorted path through the sky.   \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in zoomed toward her through a blur of flickering neon. \"Moving away from us.\" \n\n\"Shouldn't be moving at all.\" Sloane turned to her Ghost. \"Let's get that perimeter set. The Hive'll come again tonight.\" \n\nBefore she could move, the Pyramid began shedding Scales from its hull. They hovered for a moment over where they'd detached and peeled away, revealing opalescent flesh. \n\nSuddenly, the Pyramid emitted a wave that struck Titan, and a half-remembered tone resonated through Sloane's mind. With it, a lifetime: every experienced moment in a slurry of vivid flashes, condensed into simultaneous chaotic anarchy, grasping at grief, joy, anger, love. Seen from where she stood, past experiences gained new perspectives; memories best left dusted with rosy haze shrank under harsh light. Warmth, too fleeting, cold, still, ever frigid in its isolation\u2026  \n\nAnd something else, sifting through it all, drawing it to order, as if rearranging fractured collagic panes into a new image.  \n\nShe struggled to breathe, and her suit flexed against the weight of her years, splayed out across time in violating fashion. Then just as suddenly, they were gone, faded into dreams.  \n\nThe sky turned black and orange like a fire-screen, and thunder resonated. \n\nSloane's body pitched forward over the platform, sinking through air, then sea. Heavy metal was swallowed whole; consciousness faded into the black. \n\nHer experience tumbled through sharded eras of reality like an astral projection, even as she felt her feet still firmly planted in the present. A cascade of timeless scenes whirled by, like panes of life captured in glass, in an indefinite stream of consciousness. Scenes of Titan, of a vibrant seascape installation. Too familiar not to be memories. \n\nNot hers, but no less real. \n\nTheir point of focus left Titan, dragged backwards across the lonely expanse of space to a world she'd never seen.  \n\nIts seas full of vivacious promise. Its moons conceal a Watcher in the sky. Its waves breed insidious appetite in the deep. \n\nThere is a temptation there she craves but does not understand. Unnatural and cursed. \n\nShe fell again, guided. Through a song, a memory, an image of a dream bent into perception like a focusing lens. Unreality coated in familiar skin. An attempt at understanding. \n\nThe Tower. Friends and comrades. Shine and grime, all. A heralded return. A shadow drawn overhead. A battle delayed, returning. \n\nThe Tower, a time yet lived. Black shadows that would fill an empty void in the sky, extending impaling blades down into the streets. Pinning life in paralytic mockeries of contentment. A display that strangles agency. \n\nA serpent winds a path beneath the shadow and offers to guide.  \n\nShe remembered this happening, and that it had not yet happened.",

She dragged a hand through methane fluid to her faceplate, absentmindedly trying to rub the grogginess from her eyes.  \n\nMotion in the dark surrounding her kicked up clouds of fine grit.  \n\nHer headlights flared as her fingertips clinked against her helmet\u2014a Thrall came screaming into the beam of light, bubbles spewing from its jaws. Sloane's eyes went wide before she reflexively flipped the Thrall over her shoulder and kicked its jaw through its skull. Her power suit spooled and pushed stimulants reactively. \n\nShe pivoted and caught the sword of a Knight mid-swing, snapping the weapon in two between the fingers of her gauntlet and driving a shard of broken blade into its chest. Another Thrall crossed her headlights just before a silver streak whistled through its throat. Sloane eyed a selection in her visor, which hi-lighted over thirty dead Hive, slowly deteriorating in boils of tiny, rumbling ignitions that sent nerve-spasms through their husks. Her visor cleared the readings and snapped onto a friendly.  \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in drifted forward, Hive viscera gently wafting into the sea from the slender razors protruding from her shell. \"You were out for days.\" \n\nSloane's face wrinkled in confusion. \"I remember the Pyramid wave. Falling\u2026 dreams. Are you okay?\" \n\n\"Hive found us, like you said,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in said, retracting her blades. \n\nSloane grabbed the Ghost and hugged her to her power suit chassis for a moment. \"Little killer. Really gave 'em the business.\" \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in chirped. \"Pyramid wave swept over Titan, bounced around a bit and centralized where the Pyramid stopped. Gravity went crazy, then the ocean. I think we're a few miles from where we were when all this started.\" \n\n\"The Pyramid stopped? Then that's where we're headed\u2026 after we grab some gear,\" Sloane said. \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in dipped forward. \"One more thing. Something's out there circling us. Not Hive. Can't quite pin it down, but it's big.\" \n\n\"Yeah?\" Sloane said, thinking of what went through her mind before she lost consciousness. \"Then let's not waste any time getting out of here.\" \n\n*** \n\nSloane lifted herself from the ocean onto a half-submerged Arcology platform where she'd stowed a variety of rations and munitions since Titan's skies went dark. Her power suit clattered against the steel-mesh floor; she waited for the echoes to die down before taking a moment to exhale in silence. In that quiet moment, she made out a faint voice.  \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in rose into view. \"Do you hear that?\" \n\n\"Was about to ask you\u2026\" Sloane said, standing. She snatched First In, Last Out from a stow locker, racked the foregrip, then followed the voice down a barnacle-crusted causeway to an old research lab with S\u00edoch\u00e1in in tow. \n\nFluid trickled down cracked walls surrounding rows of dead monitors. Glass reflected prismatic color from a gnarled tear in reality at the lab's center\u2014as if it had been carved from another epoch and affixed to this one.  \n\nA Human that didn't seem to notice them paced within the tear\u2014standing in a fully functioning mirage of the Arcology. Once he turned toward them, the tear spasmed and lurched forward and backward in time at erratic durations and speed. He was ripped both ways into non-existence as the tear flittered through events like a fourth-dimensional montage. \n\nThe tear held steady again, returning the man and his moment to existence. S\u00edoch\u00e1in took note of the badge on his coat that read \"Gideon Tepin\u2014NPA\u2014Senior Marine Biologist.\" \n\nTepin looked upset and turned away before speaking. \"She's afraid. That's why we're all having them. Something's wrong. She's showing us what's coming in plain view!\" The man angrily swiped his hand through the air in Sloane's direction. \"It's like she's screaming it into my head. I know I'm not the only one hearing it.\"  \n\n\"It chose us.\" He stepped forward and placed his hand on the border between then and now. \"I'm dreaming my own memories, but with little differences. Little omens. Black ships in the sky.\" \n\nSloane leaned forward, hand nearly pressed to that of the living memory playing out before her on the other side of the tear. \n\n\"She's trying to warn us. We should evacuate. We have to get her\u2014\" \n\nThe tear lurched again, ripped away; lost to the rushing passage of time and blinked into non-existence. Gone. \n\nSloane dropped her hand. Jaw clenched. \"See if you can dig up any Arcology records on this.\" \n\n*** \n\n\"That marine biologist\u2026 Tepin\u2026 was he in some sort of captured time fluctuation? Is that\u2026 even possible?\" Sloane asked. \n\n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in said. \"I'm not really sure.\" \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in skimmed archived reports. \"It's under 'TLev-01.' Looks like a psychic space whale some biologists were studying out in the ocean. They never got accurate measurements, but this estimate can't be correct. Over 150 meters? Report says it wasn't from here though, and refers to a lot of visions that personnel were having\u2026 which is\u2026 odd? Not a lot of alien species in Sol until after the Golden Age.\" \n\n\"I was having dreams while I was out, S\u00edoch\u00e1in. Of some other world, the Pyramid on Titan\u2026 the Tower. Like I remembered being there for each one.\" \n\n\"Well, I guess it could be an ancient space whale\u2026 or sometimes the Traveler gives people dreams. But are we going to ignore the obvious 'you were rendered unconscious by a Pyramid wave' explanation?\" \n\n\"No\u2026 but we've seen enough weird not to knock it,\" Sloane sighed.  \n\n\"Sure. I'll log that away,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in said. \"You know\u2026 the readings coming from inside that field Tepin was in were consistent with atmospheric records on Titan during the Collapse.\" \n\n\"What does that mean?\" Sloane looked back to the spot of warped space-time. \"Was he\u2026 real?\" \n\n\"I don't know. I just know it wasn't a simulation.\"",

                "ExtLore": "Sloane deftly maneuvered across the open ocean floor. Together with her Ghost, she'd chased the Pyramid's signals across Titan, but arrived too late at each coordinate site. They'd encountered nothing more than further wounds in the fabric of reality; slivered glimpses into moments held in Titan's memory. Occasionally, discarded Shrieker cores littered a site\u2014evidence of a ritual gone cold, but not so cold that S\u00edoch\u00e1in couldn't detect figments of resonant residue that drove her scanners haywire. \n\nMore than once, Sloane had found a clutch of disoriented Fallen scattered around these wounds, some in a stupor, most driven violently mad. S\u00edoch\u00e1in said their brain patterns were fractured\u2014synapses burnt into conflicting circuited loops\u2014as if their collection of experiences had been dissected and left disparate and apart.  \n\nBut Sloane felt drawn, across the barren seafloor, to each new site shrouded in sunless shadow. Something cut through that Dark. Guided her. As if she drafted behind a rogue wave. \n\n\"We're almost to the next site,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in said. \n\n\"Let's pick it up.\" The methane flowed over Sloane's armor in a slick, slipstream current that left a long tail of particulate floating in her wake, agitated by oxygen bubbles spurting from her mask. S\u00edoch\u00e1in followed close behind, sweeping the area with light beams that dissipated over vast, featureless depths. \n\n\"Resonant Pyramid energy, neutrino dispersals, and some kind of\u2026 quantum entangling? That's the best I can make of it,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in said, razor blades deployed. \"The Pyramid's moving again.\"  \n\n*** \n\nThe site seemed quiet on the surface. Sloane glanced over a sea cliff and tapped S\u00edoch\u00e1in, who had been leering out at the expansive of dark ocean as if she was tracking something.  \n\n\"You ready?\"  \n\nThe Ghost turned to Sloane and hesitantly tilted her shell into a nod. \n\nThey killed their lights, allowing the bio-luminescent coral around them to illuminate the path down to a newly split-open gorge infested with Taken corruption. Sloane swapped her visor to a thermal targeting overlay and slipped over the edge of the chasm. Tendrils of Taken malignance flowed from the split ground beneath her, dancing in the methane like noxious filaments. The fissure looked large enough for her to finagle her suit through safely.  \n\nSloane glanced over her shoulder and held up a hand to S\u00edoch\u00e1in. \"Watch my back\u2026 from a distance.\" \n\n\"Uh, no. I can fight,\" she bit back defiantly. \"Fallen, Hive, and Taken are all over this sector.\" \n\n\"Lie low on this one. If something goes wrong, it can't go wrong with you. Get me?\" \n\nShe landed in a small cavern where a tangle of Taken threads writhed around a decrepit Hive sigil of resilient witchcraft. Whispers spewed from the sigil, wrapped around her mind, coaxed her forward. She reached a hand toward the sigil, and methane burst around her like depth charges as Taken blights manifested a small detachment of soldiers. \n\nSloane spun, her fists crackling with lightning\u2014her fingers weaving her Arc Light safely through the methane around her. She charged the first of three blights, thruster-dodging incoming fire pinged by her HUD. She broke through the blight screen, planted her feet, and threw a lightning punch like a gauss cannon, atomizing the Taken and the blight itself. Her power suit carried her fulgurate fists from hostile to hostile in rising, truculent battle-fervor. \n\nWhen the cavern quieted, Sloane turned back to the sigil and called S\u00edoch\u00e1in down. \"I can\u2026 hear the Taken through this sigil\u2026 thing. It's like they're broadcasting out loud. Not in words but\u2026 their proximity, like sonar. Can you tap into it?\" \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in's concerned response was muffled by an intrusive thought echoing from somewhere far off, circling the sea around her and draining off into her mind. \n\n|Take| \n\n|Live| \n\nSloane thought of the ocean shelves crawling with the Pyramid's minions, their rituals and corruption sinking deeper into Titan's mantle by the day. Of the armies they threatened to summon, of what they searched for in the deep. \n\nShe thought of the Fallen who had no way to flee, shocked into madness by the reality-wounding waves that swept over Titan like a grey-matter line. A terminator of experience, via suspension within it. With this foreknowledge of her enemies' plans, maybe she could be a step ahead of dusk. \n\n|Take| \n\n |Live| \n\nSloane stepped forward, dazed\u2014her mind drowning in the ocean's dangers\u2014and gripped the sigil. The rippling Taken energy immediately backfired in a blinding burst of energy. \n\n\"No!\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in dove forward in horror as Taken tendrils twisted around Sloane's armor and dragged her to the ground.  \n\n\"SLOANE!\" \n\nAs tendrils buried themselves into her flesh, Sloane heard a new voice, clear as sirens in a storm. \n \nWARRIOR OF THE SKY.  \n\nYOU ARE KNOWN TO ME.  \n\nI ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENGE.",

They'd been walking through desolate nothingness for days, tracking the next site. \"We need to keep hitting them.\" \n\n\"It's been over a year of chasing Pyramid waves, of the blight. You're getting worse.\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in's shell cut like fins through the methane, \"And there IS something out there. It's been trailing us, or ahead of us\u2026\" \n\n\"I know. It's something old.\" Sloane's voice was flat. \"I told you; I think it's been talking to me.

Rations are\u2026 look, we need to finish the mission while I'm still in fighting condition.\" \n\n\"Titan's gone, Sloane.\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in rose and drifted past her. \"What happens if you die somewhere too dark to drag you back? Have you considered that?\" \n\n\"This coming from the gung-ho Ghost, taking on the whole Hive army with a set of shaving razors.\" Sloane chuckled to herself. \"Seriously, are you expecting to live through\u2026 whatever this is?\" \n\n\"No,\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in said meekly. \"I hoped you would.\" \n\nThe firm lines of Sloane's expression crumbled for an instant. \n\nThis was unlike them. \n\nShe shut her visor, cleared her throat, and turned to continue marching. \"No more fighting, for you. That's an order.\" \n\n\"But that's\u2014I was saying that to you!\" The Ghost zipped forward. \"Hey! Don't walk away from me!\" \n\nSloane stopped. The heavy metal around her boots sank into the silty sea floor. \"I'm not\u2014there's NOWHERE to walk away TO!

                "ExtLore": "Sloane knelt, unable to stand. All the weight of Titan's ocean around her was nothing compared to the pressure of Xivu Arath's will pinning her down.\u202f \n\nA horde of gnashing Hive bore lipless smiles around a single Taken Knight. He stood tall before her, brandishing a gleaming blade that anchored an oppressive terrace of sharpened obsidian. The terrace loomed over their heads. A voice cut through the gnashing\u2014eager-toned, like running blood.\u202f\u202f \n\nSOLDIER OF THE SKY, YOUR STRENGTH WANES, YOUR STRATEGY TOO OBVIOUS.\u202f \n\nYOU TOOK WITHOUT CLAIM, AND NOW I CLAIM YOU.\u202f \n\nTHE SKY, DRAWN TO FALL ONCE MORE, PINNED BY NIGHT'S BLADE.\u202f \n\nSUMMON YOUR MEAGER LIGHT, YOUR SKY TETHER, YOU ARE DEFEATED.\u202f \n\nXivu's voice rose from her projection, booming from the Black Terrace with laughter like screaming fear.\u202f \n\nYOUR BEARER NEEDS YOU, GHOST.\u202f \n\nBE BRAVE.\u202f \n\nSloane felt needles of intent thread between the gaps in her armor, hook into her muscles, and slowly peel away the power suit's deep-set rivets from inset bone. A violent unraveling to a slow and painful end.\u202f \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in watched the torture from rocky concealment, razors extended, waiting for an opportunity to strike. Minutes felt like hours, but Sloane clung to life in a cloud of crimson-tinged mist.\u202f\u202f \n\nDelirium and agony fogged Sloane's mind, but an offer pierced through the cacophony of War. She heard it in her mind as if she had thought it herself. A broken promise:\u202f \n\n|Bond|\u202f \n\n|Live|\u202f \n\nShe considered the offer.\u202f \n\nS\u00edoch\u00e1in rushed forward, unwilling to watch any longer, and whirled through a swarm of Thrall with her blades. If she could reach Sloane, if she could just cut her free\u2014\u202f \n\nXivu Arath shrieked with whetted laughter.\u202f \n\nTHIS MORSEL IS MINE TO CONSUME.\u202f \n\nLances of pure onyx thrust through the sea to impale the little Light. The Terrace bulged and surged forward, swelling, as if to burst. For a moment, S\u00edoch\u00e1in believed Xivu Arath would burst through the Black Terrace herself, wielding a blade in corporeal hand; War's presence emanated with such strength.\u202f\u202f \n\nInstead, a gargantuan serpent crashed through the projection and snatched the Knight into its cavernous jaws as it surged by, shattering the Terrace's connection to the Knight. Eruptions of soulfire swallowed the Terrace and branched through the methane as the projection imploded on itself. The serpent dove, its enormous form overtaking and dwarfing the crumbling Terrace projection. It twisted above them, unfurling a portion of its tail to sweep aside scores of Hive with ease and sending plumes of sediment into a thick, obfuscating fog.\u202f \n\nSloane collapsed, and S\u00edoch\u00e1in rushed to her side, cutting through an Acolyte before it could raise its shredder. \"We need to go! Get up!\" S\u00edoch\u00e1in exclaimed and began stitching Sloane's gushing wounds and mending bones where she could. All around them, the Hive fired wildly into the sea, the soulfire pops of their deaths spurring tiny, muted explosions as it reacted with liquid methane.\u202f \n\nBefore S\u00edoch\u00e1in could get Sloane to her feet, the serpent slammed down in front of them, belly first, and shielded them from retaliatory Hive salvos. S\u00edoch\u00e1in darted in front of Sloane, razors ready against this giant beast, but the serpent simply looked at the Titan, its massive eye spanning more than three of her, shoulder to shoulder. Once more, Sloane heard the promise in her mind.\u202f \n\n|Bond|\u202f \n\n|Live|\u202f \n\nAnd so, they struck an accord.",
